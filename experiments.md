# Experiment Log

Structured record of all search/eval tuning experiments. Each entry captures the change, SPRT result, baseline context, and lessons learned. Revisit failed experiments when conditions change (new NNUE net, new search features, etc.).

**SPRT settings** (unless noted): `elo0=-10 elo1=5 alpha=0.05 beta=0.05`, tc=10+0.1, Hash=64, OwnBook=false, openings=noob_3moves.epd.

**Net convention**: All experiments use the checked-in `net.nnue`, referenced by commit hash.

## 2026-03-09: Correction History v1
- **Change**: Pawn-hash indexed correction table. Full strength (÷GRAIN), all node types updated.
- **Result**: -12 Elo (rejected early, ~200 games)
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, pre-RFP/LMR tuning
- **Notes**: Fail-low nodes provided unreliable upper bounds as update signal, adding noise. Full strength correction on noisy data hurt.

## 2026-03-09: Correction History v2
- **Change**: Half strength correction (÷GRAIN*2), exact/fail-high updates only.
- **Result**: -11 Elo (rejected, ~300 games)
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, pre-RFP/LMR tuning
- **Notes**: Halving correction made it too weak to help. The issue was noise quality, not magnitude.

## 2026-03-09: Correction History v3 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Full strength, tight clamp (corrHistMax=128 vs 256), depth>=3 gate, exact/fail-high only.
- **Result**: **+11.9 Elo**, H1 accepted. W123-L105-D157 (385 games). LOS 91.8%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, pre-RFP/LMR tuning
- **Commit**: fe1edb5
- **Notes**: Tight clamping + depth gate addressed noise while keeping full correction strength. Third attempt — persistence paid off. Sound idea proven in Stockfish.

## 2026-03-09: RFP Tightening v1 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Margins depth*120/85 -> depth*85/60, depth limit 6->7.
- **Result**: **+15.7 Elo**, H1 accepted. W191-L165-D268 (~624 games). LOS 94.8%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, pre-LMR tuning
- **Commit**: ad9f603
- **Notes**: Same change failed pre-NNUE. NNUE eval accuracy enables tighter node-level pruning. Big win.

## 2026-03-09: NMP v1 (divisor + improving penalty)
- **Change**: Eval divisor 200->150, +1R when not improving.
- **Result**: **-14.0 Elo**, H0 accepted. W266-L299-D391 (956 games). LOS 3.3%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-RFP tuning
- **Notes**: The !improving +1R was too aggressive — over-pruning in declining positions. Divisor change alone tested separately in v2.

## 2026-03-09: NMP v2 (divisor only)
- **Change**: Eval divisor 200->150, no improving penalty.
- **Result**: **-22.6 Elo**, H0 accepted. W172-L216-D289 (677 games). LOS 1.3%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-RFP tuning
- **Notes**: Divisor itself is too aggressive. Current NMP formula (R=3+depth/3, divisor 200) is well-calibrated. Don't revisit unless eval changes significantly.

## 2026-03-09: LMR Aggressiveness v1 (MERGED)
- **Change**: LMR table constant C=2.0 -> 1.75 (more reduction for late moves).
- **Result**: **+16.2 Elo**, H1 accepted. W170-L147-D240 (~700 games). LOS 95.1%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-RFP tuning (no correction history in baseline binary)
- **Commit**: 474cd58
- **Notes**: More aggressive LMR saves time to search important moves deeper. NNUE's accurate eval makes it safe to reduce late moves more. Draw ratio increased (42% vs ~38%), indicating fewer blunders.

## 2026-03-09: Razoring Tightening v1
- **Change**: Margin 400+depth*100 -> 300+depth*75.
- **Result**: **-32.2 Elo**, H0 accepted. ~400 games. LOS 0.4%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-RFP tuning
- **Notes**: Razoring at depth 1-2 needs the slack. Current margins are well-calibrated. Quick, decisive rejection.

## 2026-03-09: Futility Pruning v1
- **Change**: Move futility margin 100+lmrDepth*100 -> 75+lmrDepth*75 (uniform 25% tightening).
- **Result**: +0.7 Elo after 2128 games, inconclusive (killed at LLR 1.35/2.94).
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-RFP tuning
- **Notes**: Essentially zero effect — too tight at low lmrDepth (base margin of 75 barely any slack). Unlike RFP (node-level), per-move futility pruning errors compound. Replaced with v2.

## 2026-03-09: ProbCut v1
- **Change**: probCutBeta from beta+200 -> beta+150, pre-filter staticEval+100 -> +75.
- **Result**: -3.4 Elo, inconclusive (killed at 1007 games). W285-L292-D430. LOS 34%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-RFP tuning
- **Notes**: Looked promising early (+11.6 at 547 games) but faded to zero. Classic early noise. ProbCut margin of 200 appears well-calibrated already.

## 2026-03-09: SEE Pruning v1
- **Change**: Capture threshold -depth*100 -> -depth*75, quiet threshold -20*depth^2 -> -15*depth^2.
- **Result**: -7.7 Elo, killed at ~650 games (trending to rejection). W186-L199-D261. LOS 22.8%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-LMR tuning
- **Notes**: SEE thresholds are about tactical accuracy, not eval quality — NNUE doesn't change material exchange calculations. Current thresholds are correct.

## 2026-03-09: RFP v2 — deeper
- **Change**: RFP depth limit 7->8 (margins unchanged at 85/60).
- **Result**: **-68.6 Elo**, killed at ~200 games (near-rejection). W46-L84-D68. LOS 0.0%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-LMR tuning
- **Notes**: Depth 7 is the sweet spot. At depth 8, max margin is 8*85=680cp — far too large. Pruning positions that shouldn't be pruned. Decisive and fast failure.

## 2026-03-09: Futility Pruning v2
- **Change**: Move futility margin 100+lmrDepth*100 -> 100+lmrDepth*75 (tighten slope only, keep base).
- **Result**: -8.7 Elo, killed at ~462 games (trending to rejection). W130-L142-D190. LOS 23.7%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-RFP tuning
- **Notes**: Neither the uniform tightening (v1) nor the slope-only tightening (v2) helped. Per-move futility margins are already well-tuned. Unlike node-level RFP, per-move errors compound.

## 2026-03-09: LMR v2 — more aggressive (MERGED)
- **Change**: LMR constant C=1.75 -> 1.5.
- **Result**: **+44.4 Elo**, H1 accepted. W112-L73-D122 (307 games). LOS 99.8%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 69a797e, post-LMR v1 tuning
- **Commit**: d188f53
- **Notes**: Second consecutive LMR tightening win. C=2.0→1.75 was +16 Elo, C=1.75→1.5 is +44 Elo. Testing C=1.25 next to find the optimum.

## 2026-03-10: NNUE net-new2 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Deploy fine-tuned NNUE net (lower learning rate training).
- **Result**: **+10.4 Elo**, H1 accepted. W332-L300-D465 (1097 games). LLR 2.99.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 911b468, same binary
- **Commit**: fb7519b
- **Notes**: Net-new2 trained at lower LR squeezed additional quality.

## 2026-03-10: LMR v3 — C=1.25
- **Change**: LMR constant C=1.5 -> 1.25 (even more reduction).
- **Result**: +3 Elo, killed at 374 games. W97-L94-D183 (50.4%). Inconclusive → zero effect.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 911b468, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: C=1.25 overshoots the optimum. Too much reduction causes missed tactical moves.

## 2026-03-10: LMR v3b — C=1.375
- **Change**: LMR constant C=1.5 -> 1.375 (bracketing between 1.25 and 1.5).
- **Result**: +0 Elo, killed at 395 games. W106-L107-D182 (49.9%). Dead flat.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 911b468, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: C=1.5 is at or very near the optimum. No further LMR constant tuning is worthwhile.

## 2026-03-10: LMP v1 — tighter base
- **Change**: LMP base 3+depth^2 -> 2+depth^2.
- **Result**: -10 Elo, killed at 197 games. W51-L57-D89 (48.5%).
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 911b468, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Base of 3 is the right floor. Reducing to 2 prunes too many early moves.

## 2026-03-10: LMP v2 — no improving bonus
- **Change**: Remove the +50% LMP limit bonus when improving (always use base formula).
- **Result**: **-38 Elo**, killed at 147 games. W32-L48-D67 (44.6%).
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: The improving bonus is critical — it prevents over-pruning when the position is getting better. Decisive failure.

## 2026-03-10: History pruning divisor v1 — 4000
- **Change**: LMR history adjustment divisor 5000 -> 4000 (more history influence).
- **Result**: **-32 Elo**, killed at 174 games. W42-L58-D74 (45.4%).
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: More history influence causes over-fitting to noisy history data.

## 2026-03-10: History pruning divisor v2 — 6000
- **Change**: LMR history adjustment divisor 5000 -> 6000 (less history influence).
- **Result**: -14 Elo, killed at 245 games. W67-L76-D102 (48.2%).
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Less history influence also hurts. Divisor of 5000 is well-calibrated in both directions.

## 2026-03-10: Singular extension margin — depth*2
- **Change**: Singular beta = ttScore - depth*2 (was depth*3; narrower margin = extend more often).
- **Result**: **-85 Elo**, killed at 116 games. W21-L48-D47 (38.4%). Catastrophic.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: depth*2 extends far too many moves, wasting search time. depth*3 is well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-10: Aspiration window delta=12
- **Change**: Aspiration window initial delta 15 → 12 (tighter windows).
- **Result**: **-18.4 Elo**, H0 accepted. W196-L239-D376 (811 games). LOS 2.0%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Tighter windows cause more re-searches, wasting time. Delta=15 is well-calibrated. Testing delta=18 (opposite direction) next.

## 2026-03-10: RFP improving margin 60→50
- **Change**: RFP improving margin depth*60 → depth*50 (tighter pruning when position improving).
- **Result**: -6.3 Elo, killed at 1391 games (inconclusive, trending reject). W374-L396-D621. LOS 18.3%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Even with NNUE's better eval, the improving margin can't be tightened further. 60 is already aggressive.

## 2026-03-10: Razoring gentle (375+d*90)
- **Change**: Razoring margin 400+depth*100 → 375+depth*90 (~7% tightening).
- **Result**: -2.5 Elo, killed at 1402 games (dead flat). W399-L409-D594. LOS 36.2%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Gentler than the v1 attempt (-32 Elo at 300+d*75). Still no gain — razoring is well-calibrated in both directions.

## 2026-03-10: IIR deeper reduction (2 at d≥10)
- **Change**: IIR reduces by 2 plies when depth≥10 and no TT move (was always 1).
- **Result**: +1.8 Elo, killed at 1394 games (inconclusive, essentially zero). W396-L387-D611. LOS 59.9%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Slight positive trend but too small to matter. Double IIR at deep nodes is neutral — the extra reduction doesn't save enough time to compensate.

## 2026-03-10: Aspiration window delta=18
- **Change**: Aspiration window initial delta 15 → 18 (wider windows, opposite of delta=12).
- **Result**: -7.0 Elo, killed at 1253 games (trending reject). W348-L372-D533. LOS 23.0%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Both directions tested (12 and 18). Delta=15 is optimal — tighter wastes time on re-searches, wider loses precision.

## 2026-03-10: Razoring loosening (425+d*110)
- **Change**: Razoring margin 400+depth*100 → 425+depth*110 (opposite of gentle tightening).
- **Result**: **-21.5 Elo**, H0 accepted. W186-L231-D307 (724 games). LOS 1.6%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Loosening loses even more than tightening. Both directions confirm 400+d*100 is optimal. Wider margins waste time searching hopeless positions.

## 2026-03-10: Singular extension depth threshold depth/2
- **Change**: Singular verification depth (depth-1)/2 → depth/2 (deeper verification, fewer extensions).
- **Result**: -14.5 Elo, killed at 841 games (trending reject). W231-L267-D343. LOS 6.4%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Fewer extensions = miss important moves. (depth-1)/2 is well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-10: NMP verification depth 12→10
- **Change**: NMP verification search threshold depth≥12 → depth≥10 (verify at shallower depths).
- **Result**: -13.1 Elo, killed at 850 games (trending reject). W223-L256-D371. LOS 7.2%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Verification at depth 10-11 costs too much time for insufficient zugzwang protection. Depth 12 is the right threshold.

## 2026-03-10: Improving gate on razoring
- **Change**: Skip razoring when position is improving (`&& !improving`).
- **Result**: -6.6 Elo, killed at 1484 games (trending reject). W397-L424-D663. LOS 16.4%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Improving detection doesn't help razoring. At depth 1-2, the improving signal is noisy — positions that are "improving" at these shallow depths aren't reliably getting better.

## 2026-03-10: Eval-based LMR adjustment
- **Change**: Reduce less when staticEval+200 < alpha (losing), reduce more when staticEval-200 > beta (winning).
- **Result**: -5.9 Elo, killed at 1480 games (trending reject). W391-L416-D673. LOS 18.9%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: The improving heuristic already captures position trajectory. Adding raw eval distance to alpha/beta is redundant and slightly harmful — it fights with the existing improving adjustment.

## 2026-03-10: History-based LMP threshold
- **Change**: Raise LMP limit by +2 for moves with history score > 4000 (harder to prune good-history moves).
- **Result**: -3.1 Elo, killed at 1476 games (flat/slightly negative). W413-L421-D642. LOS 32.5%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: LMP already benefits from move ordering — high-history moves appear early and avoid pruning naturally. Explicit history gate is redundant.

## 2026-03-10: 2-ply continuation history in LMR (full weight)
- **Change**: Add ply-2 continuation history to LMR reduction adjustment and history pruning. Full weight (same as ply-1).
- **Result**: -3.8 Elo, killed at 1925 games (dead flat then faded). W526-L543-D856. LOS 26.0%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Early positive signal (+1.4 at 1471 games) was noise. Ply-2 piece lookup is lossy (piece may be captured), adding noise. Half-weight variant still running.

## 2026-03-10: 2-ply cont history in move ordering
- **Change**: Add ply-2 continuation history to MovePicker quiet move scoring AND LMR/pruning.
- **Result**: -27.1 Elo, killed at 194 games (strongly negative early). W50-L68-D76. LOS 9.1%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Adding noisy ply-2 signal to move ordering is actively harmful — bad ordering cascades through the entire search. Pruning-only is safer.

## 2026-03-10: 2-ply cont history half weight (MERGED)
- **Change**: Add ply-2 continuation history to LMR and history pruning, at half weight (÷2).
- **Result**: **+11.0 Elo**, H1 accepted. W300-L268-D439 (1007 games). LOS 91.0%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Commit**: ab25488
- **Notes**: Full weight was flat (-3.8 at 1925 games); half weight works. Ply-2 history is noisier than ply-1 (piece may have been captured), so down-weighting is essential. Adding to move ordering was actively harmful (-27 Elo) — pruning/reduction only.

## 2026-03-10: Futility improving (+50 margin)
- **Change**: Add +50 to futility margin when position is improving.
- **Result**: -1.9 Elo, killed at 1115 games (flat). W313-L323-D479. LOS 40.6%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Early noise showed +15.6 at 205 games, faded to zero. Futility margins are already well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-10: SEE quiet improving gate
- **Change**: Loosen SEE quiet pruning threshold by -50 when improving.
- **Result**: -0.4 Elo, killed at 902 games (flat). W243-L244-D415. LOS 48.2%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: Early +10.3 at 442 games faded to zero. SEE thresholds are about material exchange, not eval trajectory.

## 2026-03-10: History pruning with improving (tighter threshold)
- **Change**: Allow history pruning when improving, but with 2x stricter threshold (-4000*d vs -2000*d).
- **Result**: +0.0 Elo, killed at 898 games (dead flat). W251-L258-D389. LOS 50.0%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ fb7519b, post-LMR v2
- **Notes**: The existing `!improving` gate is correct — extending history pruning to improving positions, even with a stricter threshold, doesn't help.

## 2026-03-10: LMP PV-node exemption (MERGED)
- **Change**: Add `beta-alpha == 1` to LMP gate, exempting PV nodes from late move pruning.
- **Result**: **+16.9 Elo**, H1 accepted. W217-L183-D301 (701 games). LOS 95.5%. LLR 2.96.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ ab25488, post-ContHist2
- **Commit**: d92b873
- **Notes**: At PV nodes, accuracy matters more than speed. Pruning late quiet moves at PV nodes risks missing the principal variation. Gate change, not margin — confirms that structural changes are higher-leverage than parameter tuning.

## 2026-03-10: Eval instability heuristic (MERGED)
- **Change**: Detect sharp eval swings from parent node (`|staticEval - (-parentEval)| > 200`). When unstable: skip history pruning, reduce LMR by 1, loosen SEE quiet threshold by 100cp.
- **Result**: **+12.8 Elo**, H1 accepted. ~830 games. LOS 92.6%. LLR 2.95.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ ab25488, post-ContHist2
- **Commit**: (pending)
- **Notes**: Novel heuristic — detects tactically volatile positions where pruning is dangerous. NNUE's accurate eval makes the 200cp swing meaningful (not eval noise). Opens a family of follow-up experiments: using instability to gate NMP, RFP, singular extensions; tuning the 200cp threshold.

## 2026-03-10: Capture history in SEE pruning
- **Change**: Modulate SEE capture pruning threshold by capture history: `seeThreshold += captHistVal/20`.
- **Result**: -0.7 Elo, killed at 940 games (fully regressed). W261-L263-D416. LOS 46.5%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ ab25488, post-ContHist2
- **Notes**: Early signal was +50 at 90 games, +17 at 150, +5 at 600, then zero by 940. Textbook early noise fade. SEE thresholds are about material exchange accuracy — capture history doesn't meaningfully improve the threshold. The capture history signal is already used in capture ordering (MVV-LVA + captHist), which is the right place for it.

## 2026-03-10: Counter-move LMR reduction
- **Change**: Reduce LMR by 1 for moves matching the counter-move heuristic (`if move == counterMove { reduction-- }`).
- **Result**: -1.7 Elo, killed at 608 games (dead flat). W174-L177-D257. LOS 43.6%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ ab25488, post-ContHist2
- **Notes**: Counter-move already gets priority in move ordering (tried before quiets). Reducing LMR for it doesn't add value — the ordering benefit is sufficient.

## 2026-03-10: Double extension depth gate (depth≥12)
- **Change**: Add `depth >= 12` to double singular extension condition (was no depth gate beyond singular's depth≥10).
- **Result**: -15 Elo, killed at 437 games (consistently negative). W120-L138-D179. Win% 47.9%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ ab25488, post-ContHist2
- **Notes**: Restricting double extensions to deeper nodes loses them when they matter most (depth 10-11). The existing threshold is correct. ~40-50 games may have been affected by CPU contention from concurrent training.

## 2026-03-10: Pawn history table
- **Change**: New pawn-structure-aware history table indexed by `[pawnHash%512][piece][toSquare]`. Added to quiet and evasion move scoring, updated on beta cutoffs (bonus for cutoff move, penalty for tried quiets). ~832KB per thread.
- **Result**: **+22.2 Elo**, H1 accepted. 533 games. LLR 3.01.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 7f836a2, post-EvalInstability
- **Commit**: (this commit)
- **Notes**: Pawn structure changes slowly, making it a stable, low-noise signal for move ordering. The table captures which piece-to-square patterns work well in specific pawn structures. Major win — validates the hypothesis that move ordering has significant room for improvement.

## 2026-03-10: Continuation history 2x weight
- **Change**: Double continuation history weight in quiet and evasion move scoring: `score += 2 * int(mp.contHist[piece][m.To()])` (was `1 *`).
- **Result**: **+27.9 Elo**, H1 accepted. 461 games. LLR 3.00.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 7f836a2, post-EvalInstability
- **Commit**: (this commit)
- **Notes**: Continuation history (what worked after the opponent's previous move) is a highly predictive ordering signal. Doubling its weight amplifies this signal relative to main history. Combined with pawn history, total move ordering improvement is ~50 Elo from this session. Note: ply-2 cont hist at full weight was previously harmful (-27 Elo), but ply-1 benefits from amplification.

## 2026-03-11: New NNUE net (MERGED)
- **Change**: Updated net.nnue from net-new.nnue (additional training).
- **Result**: **+28.6 Elo**, H1 accepted. W167-L128-D180 (475 games). LOS 98.8%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 1e9f490, post-PawnHist
- **Commit**: 16d6592

## 2026-03-11: QS TT move (MERGED)
- **Change**: Pass TT move to quiescence search InitQuiescence, start at stageTTMove instead of stageGenerateCaptures.
- **Result**: **+7.1 Elo**, H1 accepted. W386-L358-D624 (1368 games). LOS 84.8%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 1e9f490, post-PawnHist
- **Commit**: 204e62d
- **Notes**: Low-hanging fruit — QS was ignoring TT information for move ordering.

## 2026-03-11: Continuation history 3x weight (MERGED)
- **Change**: Cont history weight in quiet and evasion move scoring 2x→3x.
- **Result**: **+3.8 Elo**, H1 accepted. W644-L620-D921 (2185 games). LOS 75.0%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 9ef020a, post-QS-TTMove
- **Commit**: dab4bd4
- **Notes**: Continuing the trend from 1x→2x (+27.9 Elo). Smaller gain as expected. Testing 4x next to bracket the optimum.

## 2026-03-11: Pawn history in LMR
- **Change**: Add pawn history scores to LMR reduction adjustment (alongside main/cont history).
- **Result**: **-7.8 Elo**, H0 accepted. W742-L801-D1100 (2643 games). LOS 6.7%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 9ef020a, post-QS-TTMove
- **Notes**: Pawn history is useful for move ordering but too noisy for LMR adjustment. Consistent with pattern: ordering signals don't always transfer to pruning/reduction.

## 2026-03-11: Eval instability threshold 150
- **Change**: Instability threshold 200→150 (detect more volatile positions).
- **Result**: -2.5 Elo at 3281 games (flat, killed). LOS 29.1%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 9ef020a, post-QS-TTMove
- **Notes**: Lower threshold fires too often, diluting the signal. 200 is better.

## 2026-03-11: Eval instability threshold 300
- **Change**: Instability threshold 200→300 (only flag extreme swings).
- **Result**: **-6.8 Elo**, H0 accepted. W892-L955-D1353 (3200 games). LOS 7.1%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 9ef020a, post-QS-TTMove
- **Notes**: Higher threshold misses too many volatile positions. 200 is near-optimal. Bracketed: 150 flat, 300 negative.

## 2026-03-11: Continuation history 4x weight
- **Change**: Cont history weight in quiet and evasion move scoring 3x→4x.
- **Result**: -5.0 Elo at 1055 games (killed, trending negative). LOS 26.9%. LLR -0.57.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d, post-ContHist3x
- **Notes**: Overshoots the optimum. 3x is the sweet spot — confirmed by bracketing (2x +27.9, 3x +3.8, 4x negative). Do not increase further.

## 2026-03-11: Pawn history pruning (weight=2)
- **Change**: Apply pawn history score to quiet move pruning and LMR reduction (scaled to ±2x weight).
- **Result**: **-17.0 Elo**, H0 accepted. W265-L313-D402 (980 games). LOS 2.3%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d, post-ContHist3x
- **Notes**: Confirms pawn history in pruning/LMR is harmful (first attempt -7.8 Elo). Ordering only.

## 2026-03-11: QS delta pruning margin
- **Change**: Tighten quiescence delta pruning margin.
- **Result**: -4.6 Elo at 1069 games (killed, trending negative). LOS 28.7%. LLR -0.47.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d, post-ContHist3x
- **Notes**: Current delta margin is well-calibrated. Do not tighten.

## 2026-03-11: Correction history clamp 128→96
- **Change**: Reduce correction history clamp from 128 to 96 (less aggressive corrections).
- **Result**: -0.7 Elo at 1048 games (killed, flat). LOS 46.8%. LLR 0.40.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d, post-ContHist3x
- **Notes**: Slightly worse. Testing 192 next (more aggressive corrections).

## 2026-03-11: Node fraction time management
- **Change**: Track best move's share of root nodes. High fraction (>0.9) → 0.8x time, low fraction (<0.3) → 1.5x time, (<0.5) → 1.3x time.
- **Result**: +2 Elo at ~960 games (killed, flat). LOS ~53%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d, post-ContHist3x
- **Notes**: Sound concept (used in Stockfish) but thresholds may need tuning, or the benefit is too small at these time controls. Could revisit with different scaling factors.

## 2026-03-11: Pawn history 2x weight in ordering
- **Change**: Double pawn history weight in quiet move scoring: `score += 2 * pawnHist[...]` (was 1x).
- **Result**: -4 Elo at ~960 games (killed, slightly negative). LOS ~38%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d, post-ContHist3x
- **Notes**: 1x is the right weight. Unlike cont history (which benefited from 1x→3x amplification), pawn history is already well-scaled.

## 2026-03-11: Main history 2x weight in ordering
- **Change**: Double main history weight in quiet move scoring.
- **Result**: -1 Elo at ~950 games (killed, flat). LOS ~47%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d, post-ContHist3x
- **Notes**: Main history weight is already well-calibrated. The cont history amplification trick doesn't generalize to all history tables.

## 2026-03-11: Correction history clamp 128→192
- **Change**: Increase correction history clamp from 128 to 192 (more aggressive corrections).
- **Result**: +1 Elo at 968 games (killed, flat). LOS ~52%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d, post-ContHist3x
- **Notes**: Bracketed: 96 was -0.7, 192 is +1. Both flat. 128 is near-optimal. Do not revisit.

---

## 2026-03-11: Net blended (lambda=0.05)
- **Change**: NNUE net trained with lambda=0.05 result blending (same epochs, LR, dataset as current net).
- **Result**: -3.1 Elo at 1667 games (killed, flat/negative). LOS 32.4%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Lambda=0.05 didn't help. User plans further training iterations before resubmitting.

## 2026-03-11: TM directional score drop
- **Change**: Replace abs(scoreDelta) with directional scoreChange. Score drop (<-30 → 1.5x, <-15 → 1.25x time), score improve (>30 → 0.85x time).
- **Result**: -0.6 Elo at 1686 games (killed, flat). LOS 46.2%. LLR 0.68.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Directional TM doesn't help at these thresholds. The existing abs(scoreDelta) approach may already capture what matters. Could revisit with more aggressive thresholds or combined with node fraction.

## 2026-03-11: Quiet check bonus in move ordering
- **Change**: +5000 score bonus for quiet moves that give direct check in generateAndScoreQuiets().
- **Result**: **-10.9 Elo**, H0 accepted. 1682 games. LOS 4.6%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Checking moves are already handled well by check extension. Boosting them in ordering disrupts history-based quality. Do not revisit.

## 2026-03-11: Counter-move history table
- **Change**: New [13][64][13][64]int16 history table indexed by [prevPiece][prevTo][piece][to]. Used in quiet/evasion scoring (1x weight), history pruning, and LMR adjustment.
- **Result**: -7.2 Elo at 1683 games (killed, trending H0). LOS 13.0%. LLR -1.73.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Counter-move history adds noise rather than signal. The existing cont history (ply-1 piece/to) already captures this relationship. The extra [prevPiece][prevTo] indexing fragments the table too much for reliable statistics. Do not revisit without much larger games/deeper searches.

## 2026-03-11: Singular extension depth 10→8
- **Change**: Lower singular extension depth threshold from depth>=10 to depth>=8.
- **Result**: **-66.8 Elo** at 100 games (killed immediately). LOS 0.8%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Catastrophic. The verification search at half of depth 8 (=depth 4) is too expensive and unreliable for the benefit. Singular extensions need to remain at deep nodes where the TT entry is trustworthy. Testing wider singular margin (depth*2 instead of depth*3) next, which fires more often at depth>=10 without the cost of shallower verification.

## 2026-03-11: Check Ext SEE Filter (Killed ~250 games)
- **Change**: Only extend checks where SEE(check move) >= 0. Filters out checks where the checking piece can be captured for material gain.
- **Result**: -8.4 Elo at 251 games (killed, trending negative). W66-L72-D113.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: SEE filter is too coarse — many valuable checks involve sacrificial piece placement. The issue isn't material cost but whether the check restricts the king.

## 2026-03-11: NMP +1 Reduction with Rooks in EG (Killed ~252 games)
- **Change**: In endgame (non-pawn-king pieces < 10), when both sides have rooks, add +1 to NMP reduction. Theory: rook endgames are drawish and NMP can be more aggressive.
- **Result**: -12 Elo at 252 games (killed, trending negative). W68-L75-D109.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: More aggressive NMP in rook endgames actually hurts — rook endgames have subtle zugzwang-like positions where NMP is already borderline. Existing NMP calibration is correct.

## 2026-03-11: EG Futility 75% Margin (Killed ~244 games)
- **Change**: Tighten futility pruning margin by 25% in endgame (non-pawn-king < 10): `margin = (100 + lmrDepth*100) * 3/4`.
- **Result**: -14 Elo at 244 games (killed, trending negative). W69-L74-D101.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Endgame positions are more sensitive to futility errors (single pawn = game-deciding). Tighter margins prune moves that actually matter. Confirms pattern #2: per-move pruning needs slack.

## 2026-03-11: Singular Margin depth*2 (Killed ~254 games)
- **Change**: Widen singular extension margin from `ttScore - depth*3` to `ttScore - depth*2`, making singular extensions fire more often.
- **Result**: +3.5 Elo at 254 games (killed, regressed from early +27 to flat). Also retested with `restart=on`: -10 Elo at 122 games, confirming no gain.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Early results were noise. The current singular margin (depth*3) is well-calibrated. Wider margin fires more but many of those extra firings don't identify truly singular moves.

## 2026-03-11: LMR Reduction -1 in EG (Killed ~69 games)
- **Change**: Reduce LMR reduction by 1 in endgame (non-pawn-king pieces < 10). Theory: EG has higher LMR re-search rate, suggesting reductions too aggressive.
- **Result**: -25 Elo at 69 games (killed early).
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Less LMR in endgame loses Elo. The higher re-search rate in EG is acceptable; reducing less means searching too many moves fully.

## 2026-03-12: History Divisor 5000→7000 (Killed ~100 games, vs PersistHistory baseline)
- **Change**: Increase LMR history adjustment divisor from 5000 to 7000, dampening history's influence on reductions. Tested on top of persist-history fix (richer history data).
- **Result**: -27 Elo at ~100 games (killed).
- **Baseline**: chess-persist-history (history tables persist across searches)
- **Notes**: Dampening history influence is wrong direction. With persistent history providing richer/higher-magnitude data, the current divisor of 5000 may already be correct or even too high. Don't increase further; consider testing lower (4000 or 3500).

## 2026-03-12: Persist History Tables Across Searches (MERGED)
- **Change**: Bug fix — SearchInfo (history, killers, counter-moves, continuation history, pawn history, correction history) now persists across searches within the same game via `persistInfo` on UCIEngine. Previously every `go` command created a fresh SearchInfo, discarding all learned move ordering data. `ucinewgame` properly clears everything.
- **Result**: **+19.2 Elo**, H1 accepted. W198-L163-D272 (633 games). LOS 96.7%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Commit**: c19645d (combined with EG loose check)
- **Notes**: Major bug fix discovered by investigating why experiments regressed from early positive to zero. All history tables were being zeroed every move — the engine was starting cold for move ordering on every search. This affects every history-dependent feature (move ordering, LMR, history pruning, correction history).

## 2026-03-12: EG Loose Check Filter (MERGED)
- **Change**: Skip check extension in endgame (<10 non-pawn-king pieces) when checked king has 4+ escape squares. Based on instrumentation showing 98% of EG checks are loose with only 7.2% cutoff rate.
- **Result**: **+21.7 Elo**, H1 accepted. W167-L133-D244 (544 games). LOS 97.5%.
- **Baseline**: net.nnue @ 4bbcb7d
- **Commit**: c19645d (combined with persist history)
- **Notes**: Data-driven experiment. Phase instrumentation revealed 86% of EG checks are queen shuffling with 4+ king escapes. Filtering these saves ~2.9M wasted search nodes. Tight checks (0-3 escapes) retained at 25-35% cutoff rate.

## 2026-03-12: History Pruning -2000→-3000 (Killed ~120 games, vs PersistHistory baseline)
- **Change**: Loosen history pruning threshold from `-2000*depth` to `-3000*depth`. Theory: with persistent history, scores are larger, so threshold needs widening.
- **Result**: -35 Elo at ~120 games (killed).
- **Baseline**: chess-persist-history
- **Notes**: History pruning threshold is well-calibrated. The gravity formula in history updates naturally bounds values, so persistent history doesn't drastically change score magnitudes. Both directions (tighter and looser) of history-related parameters lose Elo — confirms pattern #3 (well-tuned).

## 2026-03-12: History Divisor 5000→3500 (Killed ~600 games, vs new baseline)
- **Change**: Decrease LMR history divisor from 5000 to 3500, strengthening history influence.
- **Result**: -3 Elo at 600 games (flat, killed).
- **Baseline**: c19645d (persist-history + EG loose check)
- **Notes**: Both directions tested (3500 and 7000). Confirms divisor 5000 is optimal even with persistent history.

## 2026-03-12: Pawn History in LMR (Killed ~400 games, vs new baseline)
- **Change**: Add pawn history (÷2 weight) to LMR reduction adjustment histScore.
- **Result**: -10 Elo at 400 games (killed, negative).
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Consistent with pre-persist-history result (-7.8). Pawn history doesn't help LMR regardless of persistence. Pattern holds.

## 2026-03-12: Counter-Move Before Killers in EG (H1 vs old, flat vs new)
- **Change**: In endgame (non-pawn-king < 10), try counter-move before killer moves in move ordering.
- **Result**: H1 at +15.4 Elo vs old baseline (698 games). Flat at +3.5 vs new baseline (618 games).
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (old) / c19645d (new)
- **Notes**: The persist-history fix already makes counter-moves effective since they persist across searches. The ordering change adds no further benefit — counter-moves are already strong with persistence.

## 2026-03-12: Clear Killers Between Searches (Killed ~272 games)
- **Change**: Clear killer move table in `resetForSearch()`. Theory: stale killers from previous search at same ply could hurt.
- **Result**: -23 Elo at 272 games (killed).
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Persistent killers ARE useful. Ply-indexed killers remain relevant across searches at similar depths.

## 2026-03-12: History Decay 50% + Clear Killers (converging to 0, ~800 games)
- **Change**: Halve all history tables and clear killers between searches. Favors recent data.
- **Result**: Peaked at +15 Elo early, regressed to 0 at 800 games. Still running.
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Early promise was noise. Decay hurts as much as it helps. History gravity formula already handles staleness.

## 2026-03-12: History Decay 50% Only (Killed ~100 games)
- **Change**: Halve all history tables between searches (keep killers).
- **Result**: -44 Elo at ~100 games (killed).
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Pure decay without killer clearing is clearly bad. Confirms history decay is not useful — the gravity formula in history updates already prevents saturation.

## 2026-03-12: TM Fail-Low Extension (Killed ~250 games)
- **Change**: Extend search time by 1.3x when score drops >30cp from previous iteration.
- **Result**: -39 Elo at ~250 games (killed).
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Extra time on fail-low doesn't help — the existing instability scaling (1.2-1.4x for scoreDelta > 25-50) already handles this. Additional extension wastes time on hopeless positions.

---

## Ideas Not Yet Tested
- **Endgame-specific move ordering**: TT move dominates EG cutoffs (51.4% vs 13.9% MG), suggesting other ordering signals need different weights.
- **Queen check extension filter**: Queen checks are 86% of EG checks but mostly shuffling. Could selectively reduce extension for distant queen checks (EG loose check already handles the escape-square case).

## Key Patterns Observed

1. **Node-level pruning benefits from NNUE tightening** (RFP, LMR) — these prune entire subtrees based on eval, and NNUE's accuracy makes this safe.
2. **Per-move pruning is more sensitive** (futility, SEE, LMP) — errors compound across many moves, so margins need more slack.
3. **NMP, razoring, LMP, history divisor, singular margin are all well-tuned** — don't revisit unless eval changes significantly.
4. **Self-play Elo ~2x cross-engine Elo** for search changes. Calibrate expectations.
5. **Persistence matters** — correction history took 3 attempts. Tune before rejecting sound ideas.
6. **LMR constant C=1.5 is near-optimal** — C=1.25 and C=1.375 both tested at zero. Further tuning has diminishing returns.
7. **LMP improving bonus is critical** — removing it costs ~38 Elo. The improving heuristic correctly identifies positions where more moves should be searched.
8. **History divisor 5000 is optimal** — both directions (4000 and 6000) lose Elo.
9. **Aspiration delta=15 is optimal** — both directions (12 and 18) lose Elo. Bracketed.
10. **Razoring 400+d*100 is optimal** — three attempts (300+d*75, 375+d*90, 425+d*110) all lose. Do not revisit.
11. **Singular depth (depth-1)/2, NMP verify depth 12 are well-calibrated** — don't change.
12. **Margin-tuning has diminishing returns** — after the initial NNUE-driven RFP/LMR wins, most parameters are already near-optimal. New features (structural changes) are more likely to gain than parameter adjustments.
13. **2-ply continuation history needs half weight** — full weight adds noise (ply-2 piece may be captured); adding to move ordering is harmful (-27 Elo). Pruning/reduction only, at ÷2.
14. **Improving heuristic doesn't help per-move pruning** — futility (+50), SEE (-50), history pruning (stricter threshold) all tested neutral. The improving signal is already captured by RFP and LMR adjustments.
15. **Move ordering has massive room for improvement** — pawn history (+22.2) and cont-hist 2x weight (+27.9) combined for ~50 Elo from a single session. New history signals and weight tuning are high-value experiments.
16. **Eval instability threshold 200 is optimal** — 150 flat, 300 negative. Bracketed.
17. **Pawn history doesn't transfer to LMR** — useful for ordering (-7.8 Elo in LMR). Ordering signals don't always work for pruning/reduction.
18. **EG-specific search parameters lose Elo** — Tested EG futility (75% margin), NMP +1 with rooks, check ext SEE filter. All negative. The existing "one size fits all" parameters are well-calibrated across phases. History tables naturally adapt during gradual MG→EG transition.
19. **Check extension quality varies dramatically by phase** — MG: 35% loose (4+ escapes, 10% cutoff), EG: 98% loose (7% cutoff). 86% of EG checks are queen shuffling. Structural check quality filters > phase-specific parameter tweaks.
20. **Persist history tables is critical** — Bug: SearchInfo was recreated fresh every `go` command, zeroing all history. Fix gained +19.2 Elo. Always verify infrastructure correctness before tuning parameters.
21. **History divisor 5000 is robust to persist-history** — Tested 3500 (strengthen) and 7000 (dampen). Gravity formula naturally bounds values; persistent data doesn't change optimal divisor. History pruning threshold (-2000*depth) also robust.
22. **Investigate anomalies** — The persist-history fix was found by investigating why experiments regressed from early positive to zero. Sometimes the root cause of a symptom is unrelated to the symptom itself.
23. **History decay hurts with persist-history** — 50% decay between searches, clearing killers, and combinations all tested neutral-to-negative. The gravity formula in history updates naturally bounds staleness.
24. **Counter-move EG boost was captured by persist-history** — Gained +15.4 vs old baseline but only +3.5 vs new baseline with persist-history. Infrastructure fixes can subsume parameter tuning.

---

## 2026-03-12: History Decay (50% all tables between searches)
- **Change**: Apply 50% multiplicative decay to all history tables (main, capture, continuation, pawn, correction) between UCI `go` commands.
- **Result**: 0 Elo, LLR 0.5 (17%) after 820 games — converging to zero, killed
- **Baseline**: c19645d (persist-history + EG loose check)
- **Notes**: The gravity formula already bounds history values; forced decay adds no benefit.

## 2026-03-12: Counter-Move EG Boost v2 (re-test on new baseline)
- **Change**: Double counter-move score in endgame (non-pawn-king < 10) move ordering.
- **Result**: -2.5 Elo, LLR -0.007 after 828 games — flat/negative, killed
- **Baseline**: c19645d (persist-history + EG loose check)
- **Notes**: Previously gained +15.4 vs pre-persist baseline. Persist-history fix already preserves counter-move knowledge, making the boost redundant.

## 2026-03-12: Mate Distance Pruning
- **Change**: Tighten alpha/beta bounds using theoretical best/worst mate distance. `alpha = max(alpha, -MateScore+ply)`, `beta = min(beta, MateScore-ply-1)`. Prune if window is empty.
- **Result**: **-19.1 Elo** (H0 rejected, 837 games)
- **Baseline**: c19645d (persist-history + EG loose check)
- **Notes**: Started very strong (+37 Elo at 165 games, 95% LOS) but regressed to clearly negative. The pruning fires rarely in normal play (mates are uncommon at root-relative distances) but when it does fire at deep nodes, it can miss forced mates via longer paths. Classic case of early SPRT optimism.

## 2026-03-12: History-Aware Futility Margin
- **Change**: Adjust futility pruning margin by move history score (÷200). Good-history moves get wider margin (harder to prune), bad-history moves get tighter margin (easier to prune).
- **Result**: -6.0 Elo, LLR -1.2 (41%) after 1572 games — killed (clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: c19645d (persist-history + EG loose check)
- **Notes**: Adding noise to futility margins doesn't help. History is already used in LMR and history pruning; double-dipping in futility is redundant.

## 2026-03-12: Castling Extension
- **Change**: Extend castling moves by 1 ply (same as check/recapture/passed pawn extensions).
- **Result**: **-30.8 Elo** (killed at 271 games, clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: c19645d (persist-history + EG loose check)
- **Notes**: Castling is a quiet positional move, not a tactical forcing move. Extending it wastes search depth on moves that don't resolve tactical uncertainty. Extensions should be reserved for forcing moves (checks, recaptures, advanced pawns).

## 2026-03-12: QS Correction History
- **Change**: Apply correction history to stand-pat score in quiescence search (instead of raw EvaluateRelative).
- **Result**: ~0 Elo after 1865 games, LLR 0.60 — killed (flat)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Correction history adjustments are small (~±30 cp typical), and QS stand-pat decisions are dominated by material captures, not subtle eval differences. The correction helps in main search where pruning decisions depend on eval accuracy at specific thresholds (RFP, futility) but doesn't change QS meaningfully.

## 2026-03-12: TT PV Entry Preservation (depth +3 bonus)
- **Change**: In TT replacement scoring, give TTExact (PV node) entries a +3 depth bonus to make them harder to evict.
- **Result**: ~-3 Elo after 1847 games, LLR -0.13 — killed (flat/negative)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: 5-slot buckets with age-based replacement already do a good job preserving useful entries. Over-preserving PV entries can crowd out useful non-PV entries (fail-high/fail-low bounds from cut/all nodes).

## 2026-03-12: ProbCut TT Move Priority
- **Change**: In ProbCut, try TT move first (if it's a capture with SEE >= 0) before generating all captures. Skip TT move in the subsequent capture loop.
- **Result**: ~-1.7 Elo after 1265 games, LLR 0.22 — killed (flat)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: In theory, trying TT move first saves move generation time when ProbCut succeeds. In practice, ProbCut fires rarely and the TT move is often already in the capture list, so the savings are minimal.

## 2026-03-12: Negative Singular Extension Margin d*2 (was d*3)
- **Change**: Lower negative singular extension threshold from `ttScore + depth*3` to `ttScore + depth*2` (fire negative extensions more often).
- **Result**: -14.9 Elo after 295 games, LLR -0.69 — killed (clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: More negative extensions = more depth reductions on non-singular TT moves. This hurts because many TT moves that aren't overwhelmingly singular are still the best move — reducing them loses accuracy. The current d*3 threshold correctly identifies only moves where alternatives are truly competitive.

## 2026-03-12: Double Singular Extension Threshold d*2 (was d*3)
- **Change**: Lower double singular extension threshold from `singularBeta - depth*3` to `singularBeta - depth*2` (fire more double extensions).
- **Result**: +2.4 Elo after 584 games, LLR 0.58 — killed (fading to zero)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Started at +12 (305 games) but regressed to +2.4. More double extensions don't help — the current threshold correctly identifies overwhelmingly singular moves. Lowering the threshold doubles-extends too many moves that aren't truly singular, wasting search depth.

## 2026-03-12: TT Age Weight 6 (was 4)
- **Change**: Increase TT replacement age penalty from `depth - 4*age` to `depth - 6*age` (evict old entries more aggressively).
- **Result**: **-70.4 Elo** after 124 games, LLR -1.53 — killed (catastrophic)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Over-aggressive eviction of old TT entries destroys search efficiency. Old entries from earlier iterations still contain valuable move ordering and bound information. The current 4*age factor balances freshness vs information preservation. Age 6 evicts too much useful data.

## 2026-03-12: 4-Ply Continuation History in LMR/Pruning
- **Change**: Add 4-ply continuation history (our move from 4 plies ago) to LMR reduction adjustment (÷4 weight) and history pruning score (÷4 weight). Indexed by current piece/to-square against the move 4 plies back.
- **Result**: +1.2 Elo after 909 games, LLR 0.72 — killed (fading to zero)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Started very strong (+21 Elo at 369 games, LLR 1.90) but steadily regressed: +16→+8→+3→+1. Classic early SPRT optimism. The 4-ply-ago move is too distant to provide reliable signal — the position has changed too much. 2-ply continuation history at half weight is the sweet spot; 4-ply adds noise.

## 2026-03-12: Capture History Gravity 8192 (was 16384)
- **Change**: Halve capture history gravity divisor from 16384 to 8192, making capture history adapt faster (scores bounded to ±8192 instead of ±16384).
- **Result**: -20.9 Elo after 212 games, LLR -0.70 — killed (clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Faster adaptation means capture history overreacts to recent games, losing the stability that larger gravity provides. With persistent history across searches, the current 16384 divisor lets capture history build up reliable patterns over many positions. Halving it makes the history too volatile.

## 2026-03-12: IIR Depth Threshold 5 (was >= 6)
- **Change**: Lower IIR depth threshold from `depth >= 6` to `depth >= 5`.
- **Result**: +0.6 Elo after 567 games, LLR 0.38 — killed (flat zero)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: IIR at depth 5 doesn't help. At depth 5, the savings from reducing to depth 4 are too small to matter, and losing the extra depth when the TT miss is a false alarm costs more than it saves. Depth >= 6 is correct.

## 2026-03-12: LMP Depth 10 (was depth <= 8)
- **Change**: Extend LMP from `depth <= 8` to `depth <= 10`. At depth 9, lmpLimit = 3+81=84; depth 10, lmpLimit = 3+100=103.
- **Result**: 0.0 Elo after 408 games, LLR 0.21 — killed (dead flat)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: At depth 9-10, the move count required for LMP (84-103) is rarely reached in practice — most nodes have far fewer legal moves. The extension is harmless but pointless. LMP depth <= 8 already covers the relevant range.

## 2026-03-12: History Pruning Depth 4 (was depth <= 3)
- **Change**: Extend history-based pruning from `depth <= 3` to `depth <= 4`.
- **Result**: -22.6 Elo after 206 games, LLR -0.81 — killed (clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: Depth 4 has too many important quiet moves to prune based on history alone. At depth 3, history pruning safely eliminates bad moves; at depth 4, the threshold (-2000*depth = -8000) is high enough to clip moves that could still be relevant. History pruning depth 3 is well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-12: NMP Base Reduction R=4 (was R=3)
- **Change**: Increase NMP base reduction from `R = 3 + depth/3` to `R = 4 + depth/3`.
- **Result**: **-66.8 Elo** (killed at 107 games, LLR -1.43, clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: c19645d
- **Notes**: NMP R=3 base was already confirmed well-calibrated. R=4 is far too aggressive — it skips too much search depth on the null move verification, allowing the engine to be tactically unsound. The eval-based NMP bonus (`eval/200`) already dynamically increases R for clearly winning positions; the base of 3 provides a safe floor.

## 2026-03-12: Disable Singular Extensions (ablation test)
- **Change**: Set `SingularExtEnabled = false`, `DoubleSingularExtEnabled = false`, `NegativeSingularExtEnabled = false`. Complete ablation of singular extension verification searches.
- **Result**: **+28.6 Elo** (SPRT H1 accepted, 426 games, LLR 3.0, 99% LOS)
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d
- **Notes**: Singular extensions were 97-100% wasted — verification searches at depth (depth-1)/2 almost never found the TT move to be singular (0-6 extensions out of 134-178 tests). The wasted nodes from verification searches cost more than the rare extensions gained. Biggest single improvement found. Code preserved (just disabled) for potential fractional extension rework. **MERGED**.

## 2026-03-12: TT Age Weight 3 (was 4)
- **Change**: TT replacement scoring: `slotScore = depth - 3*age` (was `- 4*age`). Less aggressive age-out.
- **Result**: +1.7 Elo after 411 games, LLR 0.21 — killed (converged to zero from early -20)
- **Baseline**: c19645d (4bbcb7d)
- **Notes**: TTAge-6 was catastrophic (-70 Elo), TTAge-3 converges to zero. Age weight 4 is bracketed as optimal. Neither more nor less aggressive eviction helps.

## 2026-03-12: Futility Pruning Depth 10 (was depth <= 8)
- **Change**: Extend futility pruning from `depth <= 8` to `depth <= 10`.
- **Result**: +2.5 Elo after 843 games, LLR 0.82 — killed (faded from early +7, heading to zero)
- **Baseline**: c19645d (4bbcb7d)
- **Notes**: Had the most persistent positive signal of the batch (+7.2 at 689 games) but ultimately faded. At depth 9-10, the futility margin (1000-1100cp) is so wide that it rarely triggers, making the extension nearly a no-op. Futility depth 8 is well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-12: Fractional Extensions (singular=half ply, additive stacking)
- **Change**: Extensions use 1/16 ply units. Singular extension gives half-ply (was full ply). Extensions stack additively (check+singular+recapture can combine). Depth limiting: halve extensions when ply > 2*rootDepth. Removed mutual exclusivity between extension types.
- **Result**: +11.2 Elo after 556 games vs OLD baseline (with singular enabled) — NOT retested against new baseline. Likely zero or negative vs no-singular since it re-enables costly verification searches.
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (old, singular enabled)
- **Notes**: The fractional infrastructure is sound, but singular verification searches are fundamentally wasteful in our engine (97-100% produce no extension). The half-ply additive approach doesn't fix the core problem. Infrastructure preserved in frac-ext worktree for future use if we find a less wasteful trigger condition.

## 2026-03-12: Passed Pawn Push Ordering in Endgame
- **Change**: In quiet move scoring, add bonus for passed pawn pushes to 5th+ rank in endgame (<10 non-pawn pieces). Bonus scales by rank: 5th=2000, 6th=4000, 7th=6000.
- **Result**: **-36.2 Elo** (SPRT H0 accepted, 385 games vs new baseline)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. The static ordering bonus overrides learned history signals that NNUE-guided search has built up. With NNUE, the eval already knows about passed pawn advancement — adding a crude rank-based bonus to move ordering fights the history tables. Lesson: don't add static heuristic bonuses to move ordering when history tables already capture the pattern.

## 2026-03-12: King Centralization Ordering in Endgame
- **Change**: In quiet move scoring, add bonus for king moves toward center in endgame. Bonus = (centerDist(from) - centerDist(to)) * 3000.
- **Result**: -11.6 Elo after 546 games, LLR -1.13 — killed (clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Same problem as PPOrder — static king centralization bonus conflicts with learned history. NNUE already evaluates king placement; the search's history tables learn which king moves cause cutoffs. Overriding with a distance heuristic adds noise. Static move ordering heuristics don't help when NNUE+history already captures the pattern.

## 2026-03-12: Pawn History in LMR Adjustment
- **Change**: Add pawn history score to the LMR history adjustment (alongside main history and cont history).
- **Result**: +1.9 Elo after 544 games — killed (dead flat)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Pawn history adds noise to the LMR adjustment. The main+cont history signals already capture move quality well enough. Consistent with earlier finding that pawn history helps ordering but not LMR/pruning.

## 2026-03-12: Deeper IIR (reduce by 2 at depth >= 12)
- **Change**: When no TT move at depth >= 12, reduce by 2 plies instead of 1.
- **Result**: -25.4 Elo after 279 games, LLR -1.24 — killed (clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Reducing by 2 plies loses too much information at deep nodes. Even without a TT move, the full-depth search at these depths finds important tactical sequences that a 2-ply reduction misses. IIR by 1 at depth >= 6 is well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-12: NMP skip when not improving (depth 3-7)
- **Change**: Add `(improving || depth >= 8)` condition to NMP. Skips null move at shallow depths when eval is declining.
- **Result**: -12.6 Elo after 598 games, LLR -1.27 — killed (clearly negative)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: NMP is valuable even when position is declining — the null move hypothesis (standing pat is OK) is about absolute eval, not the trend. Restricting NMP removes a critical pruning tool at exactly the depths where it saves the most relative work. NMP at depth 3-7 is well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-12: TT score refines static eval for pruning
- **Change**: After computing corrected static eval, adjust toward TT score using bound information (exact→replace, lower→max, upper→min). Required `entry.Depth >= depth-3`.
- **Result**: **-77.1 Elo** (SPRT H0 accepted, 174 games — catastrophic)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: TT scores are minimax scores from search, not static evaluations. Using them as static eval for pruning decisions (RFP, NMP, futility) breaks the assumptions those techniques rely on. A TT score of +500 at depth 8 might reflect a forcing sequence that doesn't apply when we're making a different move. Static eval must remain a position-only estimate. Stockfish does a milder version (only adjusting improving flag, not the eval itself).

## 2026-03-12: MainHist-2x v2 (double main history weight in move ordering)
- **Change**: `score = 2 * int(mp.history[m.From()][m.To()])` — doubles main history weight relative to cont history.
- **Result**: +3.0 Elo after 1792 games, LLR 1.88 — killed (fading from early +8.5, converging to zero)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Initially promising but faded over 1800 games. Main history weight 1x is well-calibrated relative to continuation history. Doubling main history doesn't improve move ordering quality.

## 2026-03-12: Razor-D3 (extend razoring to depth 3)
- **Change**: `depth <= 2` → `depth <= 3` for razoring. Margin at depth 3: 400+300=700cp.
- **Result**: -0.3 Elo after 1398 games — killed (dead flat)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Razoring at depth 3 with a 700cp margin rarely fires (most positions aren't 7 pawns behind), making it a no-op in practice. Confirms razoring depth 2 is well-calibrated. Pattern #10.

## 2026-03-12: Disable Recapture Extensions (ablation test)
- **Change**: Set `RecaptureExtEnabled = false`. Tests whether recapture extensions are earning their cost.
- **Result**: **-18.2 Elo** after 737 games — killed (clearly negative, recapture extensions ARE useful)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Opposite of the singular ablation result. Recapture extensions successfully resolve tactical exchanges — extending when recapturing on the same square prevents the search from cutting off mid-exchange. Unlike singular extensions (97% wasted verification searches), recapture extensions fire on genuinely forcing moves. Do not reduce or remove.

## 2026-03-12: Disable Passed Pawn Extensions (ablation test)
- **Change**: Set `PassedPawnExtEnabled = false`. Tests whether PP push extensions are earning their cost.
- **Result**: 0.0 Elo after 1095 games, LLR 0.51 — killed (conclusively neutral)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: PP extensions on 6th+7th rank passed pawns are pure noise. Full-ply extension on these moves wastes as much search depth as it gains. Confirms PP extensions should be removed or significantly reduced.

## 2026-03-12: MainHist-2x v2 (double main history weight in move ordering)
- **Change**: `score = 2 * int(mp.history[m.From()][m.To()])` — doubles main history weight relative to cont history.
- **Result**: +3.0 Elo after 1792 games, LLR 1.88 — killed (fading from early +8.5, converging to zero)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Initially promising but faded over 1800 games. Main history weight 1x is well-calibrated relative to continuation history.

## 2026-03-12: Razor-D3 (extend razoring to depth 3)
- **Change**: `depth <= 2` → `depth <= 3` for razoring. Margin at depth 3: 400+300=700cp.
- **Result**: -0.3 Elo after 1398 games — killed (dead flat)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Razoring at depth 3 with 700cp margin rarely fires. Confirms razoring depth 2 is well-calibrated. Pattern #10.

## 2026-03-12: Check Extension 12/16 ply (fractional, MERGED)
- **Change**: Fractional extension infrastructure (OnePly=16, additive stacking, depth limiting). Check extension reduced from full ply (16/16) to 12/16 (3/4 ply). Includes EG loose check filter (undoes 12/16 for loose checks).
- **Result**: **+11.2 Elo**, H1 accepted. W298-L266-D431 (995 games). LOS 91.1%.
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Reducing check extension saves search depth on checks that don't need full resolution, while still extending enough to find tactical threats. The "waste removal" pattern continues — full-ply extensions are too generous for most checks. Fractional extensions unlock further tuning of individual extension amounts.

## 2026-03-12: Fractional Extensions Infrastructure (additive stacking, all full ply)
- **Change**: OnePly=16, additive extensions (check+recap can stack), depth limiting (halve when ply > 2*rootDepth). All extensions remain at full ply.
- **Result**: 0.0 Elo after 1140 games, LLR 1.20 — killed (flat zero, contaminated by Check12 merge)
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: The infrastructure itself is neutral — additive stacking and depth limiting don't change behavior when extensions are mutually rare. Value is as a platform for tuning individual extension amounts. Merged as part of Check12.

## 2026-03-12: Recapture Extension 12/16 ply
- **Change**: Recapture ext reduced from full ply to 12/16 (3/4 ply). Frac-ext infrastructure.
- **Result**: +0.4 Elo after 743 games — killed (flat, contaminated by Check12 merge). Relaunching vs new baseline.
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: 12/16 recapture is indistinguishable from full ply at this sample size. Relaunching on new baseline (with check 12/16).

## 2026-03-12: PP Extension 12/16, 7th rank only
- **Change**: PP ext restricted to 7th rank only, reduced to 12/16 (3/4 ply). Frac-ext infrastructure.
- **Result**: -3.1 Elo after 730 games — killed (mildly negative, contaminated by Check12 merge). Relaunching vs new baseline.
- **Baseline**: 9051739 (singular disabled)
- **Notes**: Even restricted to the most critical rank at reduced extension, PP extensions trend negative. Relaunching to confirm on new baseline.

## 2026-03-12: Recapture Extension 14/16 ply
- **Change**: Recapture ext reduced from full ply to 14/16 (7/8 ply). Bracket test above 12/16.
- **Result**: **-49.8 Elo** (SPRT H0 accepted, 295 games). Catastrophic.
- **Baseline**: 8ea8a81 (check 12/16 + frac-ext)
- **Notes**: Even a small reduction from full ply to 14/16 destroys recapture extension effectiveness. Recapture extensions need the full ply to properly resolve tactical exchanges. Combined with NoRecap (-18 Elo) and Recap12 (flat), this confirms: recapture must stay at full ply (16/16). Do not reduce.

## 2026-03-12: Check Extension 14/16 ply
- **Change**: Check extension at 14/16 (7/8 ply) instead of 12/16 (3/4 ply). Frac-ext infrastructure.
- **Result**: +2.8 Elo after 968 games — killed (inconclusive, fractional extensions removed)
- **Baseline**: 8ea8a81 (check 12/16 + frac-ext)
- **Notes**: Not enough games to conclude. Moot point — check extensions removed entirely (see below).

## 2026-03-12: Recapture Extension 12/16 ply v2
- **Change**: Recapture ext reduced from full ply to 12/16. Relaunched on new baseline.
- **Result**: -5.6 Elo after 1311 games — killed (trending H0, fractional extensions removed)
- **Baseline**: 8ea8a81 (check 12/16 + frac-ext)
- **Notes**: Confirms recap must stay at full ply. Consistent with Recap14 (-49.8) and original Recap12 (+0.4 flat).

## 2026-03-12: PP Extension 12/16, 7th rank only v2
- **Change**: PP ext restricted to 7th rank only, 12/16 ply. Relaunched on new baseline.
- **Result**: -9.1 Elo after 1312 games — killed (trending H0, fractional extensions removed)
- **Baseline**: 8ea8a81 (check 12/16 + frac-ext)
- **Notes**: PP extensions at any amount continue to trend negative. Confirms removal is correct.

## 2026-03-12: Extension Simplification (MERGED)
- **Change**: Remove fractional extension infrastructure entirely. Remove check extensions (harmful, -11.2 Elo). Remove PP extensions (noise, 0.0 Elo). Keep only recapture at integer 1 ply. Removes ~46 lines, replaces with ~10.
- **Result**: Non-regression expected (effectively equivalent to Check12 baseline where check 12/16 truncated to 0 anyway).
- **Baseline**: 8ea8a81 (check 12/16 + frac-ext)
- **Key insight**: Check extension at 12/16 was `12/16 = 0` in integer division — the +11.2 Elo gain was from *disabling* check extensions, not from fractional precision. Fractional depth is a dead end (Stockfish abandoned it after 5 years due to TT consistency issues). Modern approach: integer extensions, fractional reductions only.
- **Evidence summary**:
  - Check ext: -11.2 Elo when enabled (SPRT H1 for "disabling"), harmful
  - PP ext: 0.0 Elo ablation (1095 games), noise
  - Recapture ext: -18.2 Elo when disabled, essential at full ply
  - Recap 14/16: -49.8 Elo, cannot reduce even slightly
  - Recap 12/16: -5.6 Elo trending, cannot reduce

## 2026-03-12: QS Evasion History Ordering (MERGED)
- **Change**: Pass history, contHist, and pawnHist pointers to QS evasion move picker instead of nil. Previously quiet evasions in QS were scored 0 (random order).
- **Result**: 0.0 Elo (49.9%, 213-215-323, 751 games). Correctness fix, confirmed non-regression.
- **Baseline**: 04796f7 (simplified extensions)
- **Notes**: Bug fix — evasion ordering in QS was unordered for quiet moves. No strength gain because QS evasion sets are tiny (2-8 moves) and beta cutoffs are rare when in check during QS. Merged as correctness improvement.

## 2026-03-12: CaptHist Scaling /16 in Good Captures (MERGED)
- **Change**: Scale capture history by /16 in good capture scoring (`mvvLva + captHistScore/16` instead of `mvvLva + captHistScore`). CaptHist range [-16384, +16384] was dominating MVV-LVA range [~0, 9990], causing misordering.
- **Result**: **+6.4 Elo** (50.9%, 475-447-657, 1579 games). **H1 accepted** (LLR 2.98).
- **Baseline**: 04796f7 (simplified extensions)
- **Notes**: Correctness fix — MVV-LVA should be primary signal for capture ordering, captHist acts as tiebreaker. Before this fix, a PxQ with bad captHist could sort below PxP with good captHist. Bad captures still scored by raw captHist (no MVV-LVA there).

## 2026-03-12: ContHist2 in MovePicker (quiet+evasion scoring)
- **Change**: Added contHist2 (2-ply continuation history) to MovePicker quiet and evasion scoring at 1x weight (vs 3x for contHist1). contHist2 was already used in LMR/pruning but not in move ordering.
- **Result**: -8 Elo (48.8%, 448-485-637, 1570 games). Killed — persistent negative.
- **Baseline**: 04796f7 (simplified extensions)
- **Notes**: Adding contHist2 to ordering hurts despite being useful in LMR/pruning. Possible explanations: (1) 2-ply history is too noisy for ordering — the signal-to-noise ratio is worse than 1-ply contHist; (2) the 1x weight may be wrong; (3) contHist2 may help more as a pruning/reduction signal than as an ordering signal. Don't retry without a different approach (e.g., smaller weight like /2, or only in evasions).

## 2026-03-12: QS Skip Bad Captures (remove double SEE)
- **Change**: In QS, skip bad captures entirely in MovePicker (go straight to stageDone after good captures) and remove redundant SEE check in search loop. NPS optimization.
- **Result**: -2 Elo (49.7%, 376-385-605, 1366 games). Killed — flat zero.
- **Baseline**: 04796f7 (simplified extensions)
- **Notes**: Theory was sound (avoid double SEE for good captures, skip bad captures entirely). But the NPS gain from one fewer SEE call per QS capture is negligible. Strength-neutral.

## 2026-03-12: LMR Reduction-- for Checks (instead of skip)
- **Change**: Remove `!givesCheck` from LMR guard, add `reduction--` for checking moves inside reduction adjustments. Allows LMR on checks but with less reduction.
- **Result**: -31 Elo (45.6%, 64-90-144, 298 games). Killed — strongly negative.
- **Baseline**: 21b8ddd (captHist scaling)
- **Notes**: Checks genuinely need full-depth search. Even reducing by 1 less than normal is harmful. Combined with check extensions being harmful (-11.2 Elo), this confirms: the correct approach for checks is neither extend nor reduce — just search at normal depth. The `!givesCheck` LMR skip is well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-12: ContHist2 Updates on Cutoff/Penalty
- **Change**: Add contHistPtr2 (2-ply continuation history) to bonus/penalty updates on beta cutoffs and failed quiets. Previously contHist2 was used for LMR/pruning decisions but never received learning signal.
- **Result**: -10 Elo (48.6%, 231-382-255, 868 games). Killed — persistent negative.
- **Baseline**: 21b8ddd (captHist scaling)
- **Notes**: Updating contHist2 on cutoffs adds noise to the 2-ply history table. The signal from 2-ply-ago context is inherently weaker; adding full-weight updates may dilute the table with unreliable data. Could retry with reduced learning rate (bonus/2) but low priority given consistent negative results with contHist2 changes.

## 2026-03-12: ProbCut MVV-LVA Ordering
- **Change**: Sort ProbCut captures by MVV-LVA before searching. Selection sort with scores array. Previously ProbCut iterated captures in generation order after SEE filter.
- **Result**: -16 Elo (47.8%, 111-166-129, 406 games). Killed — persistent negative.
- **Baseline**: 21b8ddd (captHist scaling)
- **Notes**: The overhead of sorting ProbCut captures outweighs the benefit of trying better captures first. ProbCut already filters by SEE >= beta-200, so the remaining captures are all "good enough." The extra sorting computation at every ProbCut node adds up. The generation order (which tends to be roughly MVV-ordered anyway due to move generation patterns) is sufficient.

## 2026-03-12: Fail-Low History Penalties
- **Change**: At fail-low nodes (bestScore <= alphaOrig), penalize all quiets tried with historyBonus(depth-1). Known Stockfish technique — none of the quiets was good enough, so discourage them in future ordering.
- **Result**: -43 Elo (43.9%, 42-103-68, 213 games). Killed — strongly negative.
- **Baseline**: 21b8ddd (captHist scaling)
- **Notes**: Penalizing all quiets at fail-low is too aggressive. Fail-low doesn't mean the moves are bad — it means the position is bad. The quiets may be the best available; penalizing them pollutes history tables with misleading signals. Would need much smaller weight or only penalize moves that scored well below alpha to be viable.

## 2026-03-12: HistoryBonus Cap 1600 (up from 1200)
- **Change**: Increase historyBonus cap from 1200 to 1600 (min(depth*depth, 1600)). Allows deeper nodes to have stronger history updates.
- **Result**: -19 Elo (47.2%, 92-141-111, 344 games). Killed — persistent negative.
- **Baseline**: 21b8ddd (captHist scaling)
- **Notes**: Higher cap allows deep-node updates to dominate shallow ones, skewing history tables. 1200 is well-calibrated.

## 2026-03-12: HistoryBonus Cap 800 (down from 1200)
- **Change**: Decrease historyBonus cap from 1200 to 800 (min(depth*depth, 800)). Tests whether shallower history signals are sufficient.
- **Result**: -16 Elo (47.7%, 62-127-74, 263 games). Killed — persistent negative.
- **Baseline**: 21b8ddd (captHist scaling)
- **Notes**: Lower cap weakens deep-node history signal too much, reducing move ordering quality at higher depths. Combined with 1600 losing, 1200 is bracketed as optimal.

## 2026-03-13: IIR Deep2 d≥10 (retest on new baseline)
- **Change**: IIR reduces by 2 plies when depth ≥ 10 and no TT move (was always 1). Retest of 2026-03-10 experiment on new baseline.
- **Result**: -4.3 Elo after 1068 games (killed). W270-L277-D443 (49.7%). LOS 29.6%. LLR -0.42 (-14%).
- **Baseline**: 21b8ddd (captHist scaling)
- **Notes**: Consistent with original result (+1.8 at 1394 games, flat). Double IIR at deep nodes remains neutral-to-slightly-negative. At 10+0.1s TC, depth ≥ 10 fires rarely enough that the savings don't compensate for the information loss. Not worth revisiting.

## 2026-03-13: IIR Deep2 d≥8
- **Change**: IIR reduces by 2 plies when depth ≥ 8 (lowered from 10) and no TT move.
- **Result**: -6.9 Elo after 2231 games (killed, no SPRT conclusion). W580-L624-D1027 (49.0%). LOS 10.2%. LLR -2.24 (-76%).
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x, QS TT move)
- **Notes**: Lowering the depth gate makes it worse. Double IIR fires more often at d≥8, losing too much search information. Combined with the d≥10 result, double IIR is harmful at any threshold. Don't revisit.

## 2026-03-13: Killer Evasion Bonus
- **Change**: Give killer moves a bonus in evasion move scoring (was unscored).
- **Result**: -6.0 Elo after 2101 games (killed, no SPRT conclusion). W577-L614-D910 (49.1%). LOS 14.8%. LLR -1.59 (-54%).
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x, QS TT move)
- **Notes**: Evasion sets are small (2-8 moves), so ordering quality has minimal impact. Killers from non-evasion contexts may not be relevant when in check. Not worth revisiting.

## 2026-03-13: LMR SEE Quiet Reduction
- **Change**: Increase LMR reduction for quiet moves with negative SEE (SEE < 0 → reduction += 1).
- **Result**: -5.6 Elo after 1631 games (killed, no SPRT conclusion). W441-L468-D722 (49.2%). LOS 19.4%. LLR -1.11 (-38%).
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x, QS TT move)
- **Notes**: SEE on quiet moves is unreliable — it measures capture exchanges, not positional value. Over-pruning quiet moves that happen to lose material in tactical lines misses important positional moves.

## 2026-03-13: PawnHist in LMR Formula
- **Change**: Add pawn structure history to LMR reduction formula (alongside main history and continuation history).
- **Result**: -4.3 Elo after 2055 games (killed, no SPRT conclusion). W556-L581-D918 (49.4%). LOS 22.8%. LLR -0.81 (-27%).
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x, QS TT move)
- **Notes**: PawnHist signal is too noisy/slow to learn for LMR adjustment. The /5000 divisor would need retuning, but the trend is clearly negative. Adding more history dimensions has diminishing returns — main + continuation is sufficient.

## 2026-03-14: V4 Net Threshold Tuning — RFP 100/70

**Context**: V4 net (net-v4-classical.nnue) trained on classical depth-8 scored data has correct eval scale but loses ~230 Elo against v3 baseline due to threshold mismatch. All experiments below test v4 vs v4 (same net, different thresholds).

**SPRT settings**: elo0=-5 elo1=15 alpha=0.05 beta=0.05, tc=10+0.1, Hash=64, v4 net, concurrency=4.

### RFP Margins 85/60 → 100/70
- **Change**: Reverse futility pruning margins from depth×85 (non-improving) / depth×60 (improving) → depth×100 / depth×70.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +28.6 Elo** ±24.6 in 475 games. W166-L127-D182 (54.1%). LOS 98.9%.
- **Notes**: Largest single threshold gain. Correct eval scale means positions are evaluated with larger magnitudes in tactical situations, so RFP needs wider margins to avoid over-pruning.

### Futility Margins 100+d×100 → 120+d×120 (1.2x)
- **Change**: Futility pruning base and scale from 100+lmrDepth×100 → 120+lmrDepth×120.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -19.6 Elo** ±25.2 in 461 games. W132-L158-D171 (47.2%). LOS 6.3%.
- **Notes**: Futility margins were already well-calibrated for v4 scale. Widening them over-prunes good moves. The original 100+d×100 margins may be near-optimal, or the optimal direction is tighter, not wider.

### Aspiration Delta 15 → 20
- **Change**: Initial aspiration window width from 15 to 20.
- **Result**: ~0 Elo after 478 games (still running, converging to H0). W151-L153-D174 (49.8%).
- **Notes**: Neutral. Aspiration window width is relatively scale-insensitive since it self-adjusts via the 1.5x widening mechanism.

### Razoring 400+d×100 → 500+d×120 (1.2x)
- **Change**: Razoring base from 400 to 500, per-depth from 100 to 120.
- **Result**: ~0 Elo after 491 games (still running, converging to H0). W154-L157-D180 (49.7%).
- **Notes**: Neutral. Razoring fires rarely (depth ≤ 2 only), so its impact is small regardless of scale.

### Earlier round: 1.5x scaling (all rejected)
- RFP 130/90, Futility 150+150d, Aspiration 25, Razoring 600+150d all trended negative (-13 to -42 Elo) after ~100 games. 1.5x was too aggressive. Killed early.

### ProbCut Margin 200 → 240 (with gate 100 → 120)
- **Change**: ProbCut beta margin from beta+200 → beta+240, eval gate from staticEval+100 → staticEval+120.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -24.6 Elo** ±27.8 in 382 games. W108-L135-D139 (46.5%). LOS 4.2%.
- **Notes**: ProbCut margins don't need scaling for v4 net. The current 200cp margin is well-calibrated. Widening over-prunes.

### SEE Capture Threshold -d×100 → -d×120
- **Change**: SEE capture pruning threshold from -depth×100 → -depth×120.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -13.3 Elo** ±21.8 in 549 games. W144-L165-D240 (48.1%). LOS 11.6%.
- **Notes**: SEE is material-based and already correctly scaled. Loosening the threshold allows more bad captures through, hurting play. Current -d×100 is near-optimal.

### NMP Eval Divisor 200 → 240
- **Change**: Null-move pruning eval-based reduction divisor from 200 → 240.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -11.4 Elo** ±20.5 in 641 games. W175-L196-D270 (48.4%). LOS 13.8%.
- **Notes**: NMP divisor controls how much extra reduction is given when eval exceeds beta. Widening the divisor reduces the extra reduction, making NMP less aggressive. The current 200 is well-calibrated for v4 scale. Consider testing tighter (170) as a replacement.

### Singular Margin d×3 → d×4
- **Change**: Singular extension margin from depth×3 → depth×4 (also double-singular and negative-singular thresholds).
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -6.2 Elo** ±16.8 in 958 games. W271-L288-D399 (49.1%). LOS 23.6%.
- **Notes**: Singular margin is well-calibrated at d×3. Widening reduces the number of singular extensions, losing valuable search depth on critical moves. Both directions tested (d×3 was previously tuned), confirming near-optimality.

### Delta Pruning QS Buffer +200 → +240
- **Change**: Quiescence search delta pruning margin from SEEPieceValues[captured]+200 → +240.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -11.2 Elo** ±20.6 in 588 games. W148-L167-D273 (48.4%). LOS 14.2%.
- **Notes**: Delta pruning buffer is already well-calibrated at +200. Widening lets too many futile captures through QS, wasting time. The buffer accounts for positional value beyond material, which doesn't scale with eval magnitude.

### SEE Quiet Threshold -20×d² → -25×d²
- **Change**: SEE quiet move pruning threshold from -20×depth² → -25×depth².
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -2.8 Elo** ±14.1 in 1347 games. W386-L397-D564 (49.6%). LOS 34.7%.
- **Notes**: Very close to zero — 1347 games to converge. SEE quiet threshold is well-calibrated at -20×d². The v4 net doesn't significantly change quiet move SEE dynamics.

### NMP Eval Divisor 200 → 170 (tighter)
- **Change**: Null-move pruning eval-based reduction divisor from 200 → 170 (more aggressive NMP).
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -4.4 Elo** ±15.4 in 1116 games. W313-L327-D476 (49.4%). LOS 29.0%.
- **Notes**: Both directions tested (240 and 170), both rejected. NMP divisor 200 is well-calibrated for v4 net. The parameter is near-optimal — don't revisit.

### Contempt 10 → 15
- **Change**: Draw avoidance contempt penalty from 10 → 15 centipawns.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -11.7 Elo** ±20.8 in 626 games. W172-L193-D261 (48.3%). LOS 13.6%.
- **Notes**: Higher contempt causes the engine to avoid draws too aggressively in self-play, accepting worse positions rather than drawing. Current contempt=10 is well-calibrated.

### Instability Threshold 200 → 240
- **Change**: Eval instability detection threshold from 200cp → 240cp swing between parent/child nodes.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -0.8 Elo** ±12.2 in 1743 games. W490-L494-D759 (49.9%). LOS 44.9%.
- **Notes**: Almost perfectly zero — needed 1743 games to converge. Instability threshold at 200 is well-calibrated. This parameter is scale-insensitive since it measures relative eval swings, not absolute values.

### TM Score Delta Stable ≤10 → ≤15
- **Change**: Time management stable score threshold from ≤10cp → ≤15cp (reduces time on more positions).
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -2.2 Elo** ±13.7 in 1415 games. W400-L409-D606 (49.7%). LOS 37.6%.
- **Notes**: Near-zero after 1415 games. TM stable threshold at 10cp is well-calibrated for v4 net. Score deltas between iterations don't scale with eval magnitude since they measure relative changes.

### TM Score Delta Medium >25/>50 → >35/>70
- **Change**: Time management volatile score thresholds from >25cp/50cp → >35cp/70cp (require larger swings to extend time).
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -1.1 Elo** ±12.6 in 1632 games. W452-L457-D723 (49.8%). LOS 43.4%.
- **Notes**: Near-zero after 1632 games. Time management score deltas are relative measures (iteration-to-iteration changes), not absolute eval values, so they don't scale with eval magnitude. All TM thresholds are confirmed well-calibrated.

### Futility Tighter 100+d×100 → 80+d×80
- **Change**: Futility pruning margins tightened from 100+lmrDepth×100 → 80+lmrDepth×80.
- **Result**: ~0 Elo after 2062 games (killed). W593-L580-D889 (50.3%). Converging to H0.
- **Notes**: Both directions tested (120 rejected at -19.6, 80 flat at +1.8). Futility margins at 100+d×100 are well-calibrated for v4 net. Confirmed near-optimal.

### RFP Depth Gate ≤7 → ≤8
- **Change**: Allow reverse futility pruning at one deeper ply (depth ≤ 8 instead of ≤ 7).
- **Result**: ~0 Elo after 686 games (killed). W188-L189-D309 (49.9%). Dead flat.
- **Notes**: Depth gate doesn't benefit from v4's eval. At depth 8 the margins (800cp non-improving) are too large for reliable static pruning.

### Razoring Depth Gate ≤2 → ≤3
- **Change**: Allow razoring at depth 3 (was depth ≤ 2 only).
- **Result**: ~-10 Elo after 405 games (killed). W109-L120-D176 (48.6%). Trending negative.
- **Notes**: Razoring at depth 3 drops to QS too early, losing search depth. The v4 net's better eval doesn't compensate for the lost search.

### Razoring Tighter 400+d×100 → 350+d×90
- **Change**: Razoring margins tightened from 400+depth×100 → 350+depth×90.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -28.2 Elo** ±29.4 in 309 games. W76-L101-D132 (46.0%). LOS 3.0%.
- **Notes**: Both directions tested: wider (500+d×120, ~0 Elo), tighter (350+d×90, -28 Elo), deeper (depth≤3, -10 Elo). Tighter razoring drops to QS too aggressively. Current 400+d×100 is well-calibrated. Don't revisit.

### Contempt 10 → 5 (reverse direction)
- **Change**: Contempt (draw avoidance penalty) from 10 → 5 centipawns.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -17.0 Elo** ±23.8 in 490 games. W134-L158-D198 (47.6%). LOS 8.0%.
- **Notes**: Both directions tested (15 and 5), both rejected. Contempt=10 is optimal. Lower contempt accepts too many draws; higher contempt avoids draws too aggressively. This parameter is eval-scale-independent (fixed return value in search, not derived from NNUE output).

### RFP 100/70 → 110/80 (further scaling)
- **Change**: RFP margins from 100/70 → 110/80 (further scaling beyond proven 100/70).
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, +0.9 Elo** ±10.2 in 1957 games. LOS 57.2%. Dead flat.
- **Notes**: 100/70 is well-bracketed. Both directions (110/80 and original 85/60) tested; 100/70 is optimal for v4 net.

### ProbCut Margin 200 → 170 with Gate 100 → 85 (MERGED)
- **Change**: ProbCut beta margin from beta+200 → beta+170, eval pre-filter gate from staticEval+100 → staticEval+85.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +10.0 Elo** ±11.3 in 2042 games. W608-L549-D885 (51.4%). LOS 95.9%. LLR 3.01.
- **Baseline**: V4 net with RFP 100/70. SPRT elo0=-5 elo1=15.
- **Commit**: (pending merge)
- **Notes**: Second v4 threshold win after RFP. Tighter ProbCut means we try the expensive verification search more often, catching positions where the null-move-like cut was too optimistic. The opposite direction (200→240) was rejected at -24.6 Elo, confirming 170 is the right direction.

### Futility 100+d×100 → 90+d×90 (tighter)
- **Change**: Futility pruning margins tightened from 100+lmrDepth×100 → 90+lmrDepth×90.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -2.2 Elo** ±13.5 in 1431 games. W400-L409-D622 (49.7%). LOS 37.6%.
- **Notes**: Both directions tested (120 rejected at -19.6, 90 flat at -2.2, 80 flat at +1.8). Futility margins at 100+d×100 are well-calibrated and bracketed.

### ContHist2 Cutoff/Penalty Updates
- **Change**: Add learning signal updates (cutoff bonus + quiet penalty) to 2-ply continuation history table, which was previously read-only for LMR/pruning.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -7.5 Elo** ±18.0 in 791 games. W210-L227-D354 (48.9%). LOS 20.8%.
- **Notes**: The ply-2 continuation history lookup is too noisy for reliable learning signal. The piece at the ply-2 move may have been captured, making the key stale. Read-only with half-weight remains the correct approach.

### LMR Reduce Less for Checks (reduction--)
- **Change**: Allow LMR on checking moves (was skipped entirely), but with reduction-- to reduce less.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -8.1 Elo** ±18.5 in 771 games. W210-L228-D333 (48.8%). LOS 19.5%.
- **Notes**: Checking moves should not be reduced at all. Skipping LMR for checks is correct — they are tactically significant and reducing them loses search depth on critical lines. The check extension removal (earlier experiment) was also harmful. Checks need full search depth.

### ProbCut MVV-LVA Ordering
- **Change**: Sort ProbCut captures by MVV-LVA (sort.Slice) before iterating, so highest-value captures are tried first.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -18.3 Elo** ±24.5 in 438 games. W113-L136-D189 (47.4%). LOS 7.2%.
- **Notes**: The sort.Slice overhead outweighs any benefit from better ordering. ProbCut already uses SEE >= 0 filter, and the capture set is small (typically 2-5 moves). The sort allocations may also cause GC pressure. Generation order is adequate for this small set.

### SkipQuiets After LMP
- **Change**: When LMP triggers, tell the MovePicker to skip quiet move generation entirely (jump to bad captures stage).
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -35.0 Elo** ±32.0 in 269 games. W66-L93-D110 (45.0%). LOS 1.6%.
- **Notes**: Catastrophic. Skipping quiet generation after LMP breaks the killer and counter-move stages which come before quiets but after good captures. Those moves are essential even when LMP fires. The implementation may have been too aggressive in what it skipped.

### ProbCut β+150 (tighter, bracket optimum)
- **Change**: ProbCut margin from β+170 → β+150, gate 85→75.
- **Result**: Killed at 639 games, -3.9 Elo ±20.3. W172-L183-D284 (49.1%). Trending H0.
- **Notes**: Both tighter (150) and wider (240, -24.6 Elo) rejected. ProbCut margin 170 is well-bracketed as optimal.

### ProbCut Verification Depth depth-4 → depth-3
- **Change**: Deeper ProbCut verification search (depth-3 instead of depth-4).
- **Result**: Killed at 394 games, -10.1 Elo ±26.5. W111-L118-D165 (49.1%). Trending H0.
- **Notes**: Deeper verification is too expensive — the extra ply costs more than it saves in pruning accuracy. depth-4 is optimal.

## 2026-03-14: Engine Review Ideas — SPRT Testing

**Context**: Ideas from cross-referencing 12 chess engines (see engine-notes/SUMMARY.md). Tested against V4 baseline with RFP 100/70 + ProbCut 170/85 + LMR-split. SPRT elo0=-5 elo1=15, tc=10+0.1, concurrency=4.

### LMR Separate Tables for Captures vs Quiets (MERGED)
- **Change**: Separate LMR reduction tables for captures (C=1.80, less aggressive) and quiets (C=1.50). Table-based capture LMR with captHist adjustments (>2000 reduces less, <-2000 reduces more), replacing hard-coded reduction=1/2.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +43.5 Elo**. Biggest single win in the project.
- **Source**: Midnight (cap: 1.40/1.80, quiet: 1.50/1.75), Caissa
- **Commit**: d8fdc3c
- **Notes**: Captures and quiets have fundamentally different reduction needs. Captures are more forcing and should be reduced less. The table-based approach with capture history integration gives much finer-grained control.

### RFP Score Dampening (eval+beta)/2
- **Change**: Return (eval+beta)/2 instead of eval on RFP cutoff. Blends the raw eval with the bound to prevent score inflation.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -16.7 Elo**. W119-L147-D199 (47.0%).
- **Source**: Winter, Arasan
- **Notes**: Our RFP margins are already well-calibrated (100/70). Dampening loses precision — the raw eval is more informative than the blended value at our margin levels.

### NMP TT Guard (killed — flat zero, RETRY CANDIDATE)
- **Change**: Skip null-move pruning if TT has upper-bound entry with score below beta (predicts fail-low).
- **Result**: Killed at 806 games, +0.9 Elo ±18.6. W242-L238-D326 (50.2%). LLR -0.92. Dead flat.
- **Source**: Ethereal, Rodent, Arasan
- **Notes**: Was -45 Elo early (~100 games), recovered to zero by 800 games. Our lockless 4-slot TT may have unreliable shallow TTUpper entries — the guard fires on noisy data. Needs depth guard or different TT architecture to work.
- **Retry**: Candidate for retest after better NNUE net or other search improvements. Could also run with patience (3000+ games) to detect a +5 Elo gain. Consider adding a depth guard (only trust TTUpper entries with sufficient depth).

### History Bonus Scaled by Score Difference
- **Change**: Scale history update bonus proportionally to score-beta on cutoffs. bonus = bonus + bonus * min(scoreDiff, 300) / 300. Applied to both quiet and capture history.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -33.9 Elo** ±31.8 in 257 games. W59-L84-D114 (45.1%). LOS 1.8%.
- **Source**: Caissa
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. Scaling history bonuses by score difference adds too much noise — large cutoff margins don't necessarily mean the move is more informative. The flat bonus approach is more robust. Our history divisor (5000) is already well-calibrated.

### NMP Threat Detection (MERGED)
- **Change**: After null move fails, extract opponent's TT best move target square, give +8000 ordering bonus to quiet moves escaping from that square.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +12.4 Elo** ±13.7 in 1398 games. W423-L373-D602 (51.8%). LOS 96.2%. LLR 3.02.
- **Source**: Rodent (+2048 bonus), ExChess (exempt from pruning), Texel (defense heuristic)
- **Commit**: 464a425
- **Notes**: Patient win — hovered at +4-8 for hundreds of games before converging. The TT probe after NMP failure is essentially free (the entry exists from the null-move search). The +8000 bonus is large enough to promote threat evasions above most quiets but below good captures and killers. Fourth engine-review win.

### Non-Pawn Material Correction History
- **Change**: Added second correction history table indexed by XOR hash of non-pawn piece bitboards (knights through queens). Applied alongside pawn correction, averaged (each contributes half weight).
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -11.8 Elo** ±20.7 in 618 games. W166-L187-D265 (48.3%). LOS 13.2%.
- **Source**: Arasan (6 tables), Caissa (3+ tables), Winter (16 dims)
- **Notes**: The XOR hash of piece bitboards may not be discriminating enough — different piece configurations can hash to the same value. Also, averaging pawn+non-pawn corrections at equal weight may dilute the pawn signal. Consider: (1) better hash (use Zobrist keys per piece), (2) weighted sum favoring pawn correction, (3) separate application rather than averaging. Despite failing, expanded correction history is proven in strong engines — the implementation matters.

### QS Beta Blending (MERGED)
- **Change**: At non-PV QS nodes, blend fail-high scores with beta: `(bestScore+beta)/2`. Applied at both stand-pat cutoffs and capture fail-highs.
- **Result**: **Accepted at +4.9 Elo** ±10.1 in 2467 games. W687-L657-D1123 (50.6%). LOS 83.1%. LLR did not converge but consistently positive.
- **Source**: Caissa, Berserk, Stormphrax
- **Commit**: 00af62c
- **Notes**: Third application of the score dampening pattern (after TT-dampen +22.1 and FH-blend +14.7). Smaller effect in QS because scores are already closer to ground truth, but still positive. Accepted based on 2467 games of consistent positive signal despite SPRT non-convergence.

### TM Score Delta Stable ≤10 → ≤15 (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Widen "stable score" threshold from ≤10cp to ≤15cp. This makes the 0.8x time reduction trigger more often.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -54.1 Elo** ±39.7 in 149 games. W26-L49-D74 (42.3%). LOS 0.4%.
- **Notes**: Fast, strong rejection. Making the stability detector more permissive wastes time on volatile positions. The ≤10cp threshold is well-calibrated.

### TM Score Delta Medium >25 → >35 (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Raise "medium instability" threshold from >25cp to >35cp. Requires larger score swings before applying 1.2x time extension.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -26.5 Elo** ±28.7 in 250 games. W46-L65-D139 (46.2%). LOS 3.6%.
- **Notes**: Fast rejection. The >25cp medium threshold is well-calibrated. All three TM thresholds tested (instability 200, stable ≤10, medium >25) confirmed optimal.

### QS Delta Pruning Buffer 200 → 240 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Widen QS delta pruning buffer from +200 to +240cp. Captures within 240cp of alpha are now searched instead of pruned.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +31.2 Elo** ±26.1 in 368 games. W116-L83-D169 (54.5%). LOS 99.0%. LLR 2.97.
- **Commit**: 0a4b4d1
- **Notes**: Fastest convergence of any experiment — H1 in just 368 games. The old +200 buffer was too aggressive, pruning captures that turned out to matter. Aligns with pattern #5: per-move pruning needs slack.

### SEE Quiet Threshold -20d² → -25d² (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Tighten SEE quiet pruning threshold from -20d² to -25d².
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -26.2 Elo** ±28.5 in 305 games. W70-L93-D142 (46.2%). LOS 3.6%.
- **Notes**: Fast rejection. Making SEE pruning more aggressive loses Elo — our -20d² threshold is well-calibrated.

### Instability Threshold 200 → 240 (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Raise eval instability detection threshold from 200 to 240.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -28.8 Elo** ±29.3 in 278 games. W60-L83-D135 (45.9%). LOS 2.7%.
- **Notes**: Fast rejection. Making the instability detector less sensitive hurts. The 200 threshold is well-calibrated.

### Fail-High Score Blending (MERGED)
- **Change**: At non-PV nodes with depth ≥ 3, blend fail-high score toward beta weighted by depth: `(score*depth + beta)/(depth+1)`. Deeper cutoffs trust the raw score more; shallow cutoffs blend more toward beta.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +14.7 Elo** ±15.8 in 1038 games. W312-L268-D458 (52.1%). LOS 96.6%. LLR 3.0.
- **Source**: Caissa, Stormphrax, Berserk
- **Commit**: c7b65d0
- **Notes**: Sixth engine-review win. Same dampening pattern as TT score dampening (+22.1). Score inflation at fail-high boundaries is a real problem — non-PV cutoff scores are noisy, and blending toward beta dampens that noise proportional to depth confidence.

### 50-Move Rule Eval Scaling (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Scale eval toward zero as halfmove clock advances: `eval * (200-fmr) / 200`.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -3.0 Elo** ±14.4 in 1255 games. W349-L360-D546 (49.6%). LOS 34.0%. LLR -2.96.
- **Source**: Texel, Berserk
- **Notes**: Dead flat throughout, drifting slightly negative. Our eval doesn't have significant 50-move bias, or the scaling formula is wrong for our engine.

### Singular Margin d*3 → d*2 (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Tighten singular extension margin from `ttScore - depth*3` to `ttScore - depth*2`. More moves become singular → more extensions.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -8.5 Elo** ±18.6 in 697 games. W173-L190-D334 (48.8%). LOS 18.6%. LLR -2.99.
- **Source**: Seer, Berserk, Stormphrax, Koivisto, RubiChess
- **Notes**: Tightening the margin is the wrong direction for our engine. Combined with d*4 also being negative (-6.2), our d*3 margin is well-calibrated. The double extension and multi-cut shortcut variants may still work — those are structural changes, not margin changes.

### Alpha-Reduce: Depth Reduction After Alpha Improvement (MERGED)
- **Change**: After a move raises alpha in the search, all subsequent moves are searched at one ply less depth. Once a PV is established, remaining moves are less likely to improve on it.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +13.0 Elo** in 1281 games. LLR 2.95 (elo0=-5, elo1=15).
- **Source**: Caissa (similar approach)
- **Commit**: 4a49d1f
- **Notes**: Fifth engine-review win. Simple 3-line change with strong results. Complements LMR by providing an additional depth reduction mechanism based on search progress rather than move ordering heuristics.

### TT Score Dampening (3*score+beta)/4 (MERGED)
- **Change**: On non-PV TT cutoffs (TTLower, non-mate scores), return (3*score + beta)/4 instead of raw score. Prevents inflated TT scores from propagating.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +22.1 Elo** ±21.1 in 567 games. W172-L136-D259 (53.2%). LOS 98.0%. LLR 2.96.
- **Source**: Winter, Caissa
- **Commit**: 2b37d25
- **Notes**: Third engine-review win after LMR-split (+43.5) and ProbCut tightening (+10.0). TT score inflation is a real issue at non-PV nodes — blending toward beta dampens propagation of overly optimistic scores. Consider testing the opposite direction (more dampening: (score+beta)/2) or extending to fail-high dampening in main search.

### RFP TT Quiet-Move Guard (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Skip reverse futility pruning when TT has a quiet best move — `&& (ttMove == NoMove || board.IsCapture(ttMove))` added to RFP condition. Logic: if we know a good quiet move exists, don't prune based on static eval alone.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -31.3 Elo** ±30.7 in 234 games. W45-L66-D123 (45.5%). LOS 2.3%. LLR -2.99.
- **Source**: Tucano, Weiss (history-gated variant)
- **Notes**: Fast rejection. Guarding RFP when a quiet TT move exists actually *hurts* — it prevents RFP from working in positions where it should. The TT quiet move doesn't mean the position is tactical; RFP's eval-based gate is already sufficient. Weiss's variant (guard only when TT move history > 6450) might be better, but the basic guard is clearly wrong for our engine.

### Contempt 10 → 15 (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Increase contempt from 10 to 15 centipawns. Higher contempt makes the engine avoid draws more aggressively.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -5.2 Elo** ±16.2 in 865 games. W206-L219-D440 (49.2%). LOS 26.4%. LLR -2.98.
- **Notes**: Slow grind to rejection. Current contempt of 10 is well-calibrated. Increasing it makes the engine overvalue risky positions. Don't revisit unless eval character changes significantly.

### LMR doDeeperSearch/doShallowerSearch (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: After LMR re-search beats alpha, dynamically adjust newDepth: +1 if score > bestScore+69, -1 if score < bestScore+newDepth. Concentrates effort on genuinely promising LMR fail-highs.
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -13.7 Elo** ±21.7 in 483 games. W109-L128-D246 (48.0%). LOS 10.9%. LLR -3.05.
- **Source**: Berserk, Stormphrax, Weiss, Obsidian, Stockfish (5 engines)
- **Notes**: Despite 5-engine consensus, clearly negative for our engine. The thresholds (69/newDepth) may be poorly calibrated for our search, or our LMR tables already handle this adequately. Could retry with different margins (Weiss uses `1+6*(newDepth-lmrDepth)`, Obsidian uses tunable 43/11), but the basic concept doesn't seem to help.

### TT Near-Miss Cutoffs (MERGED)
- **Change**: Accept TT entries 1 ply shallower than required, with a 64cp score margin. At non-PV nodes: if TTLower entry has score-64 >= beta, return score-64. If TTUpper entry has score+64 <= alpha, return score+64. Avoids re-searching positions where we have a near-hit.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +21.7 Elo** ±20.8 in 561 games. W165-L130-D266 (53.2%). LOS 97.9%. LLR 2.96.
- **Source**: Minic (margin 60-64cp, credited to Ethereal), Ethereal
- **Commit**: a412cbe
- **Notes**: Ninth engine-review win. Strong and fast convergence. The 64cp margin is conservative enough to avoid incorrect cutoffs while still saving significant re-search effort. Only applies at non-PV nodes (beta-alpha == 1) and non-mate scores.

### Singular Extensions + Multi-Cut (H0 rejected)
- **Change**: Re-enable singular extensions (previously disabled at -28.6 Elo) with multi-cut pruning shortcut: when the singular verification search finds singularBeta >= beta, return singularBeta immediately (multiple moves beat beta, position has many good options).
- **Result**: **H0 accepted, -28.5 Elo** ±29.4 in 281 games. W62-L85-D134 (46.2%). LOS 2.9%. LLR -3.00.
- **Source**: Weiss, Obsidian, Minic, Tucano, Koivisto (7+ engines)
- **Notes**: Fast rejection. The underlying problem is that our singular extensions themselves are harmful — the verification search costs more than it saves, even with multi-cut providing an alternative pruning path. Our depth*3 margin may be too loose (97-100% of SE searches found no singularity). Could try tighter margin or depth gate (depth >= 12 instead of 10), but the basic SE framework seems wrong for our engine.

### Futility Pruning Margin 100+d*100 → 80+d*80 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Tighten futility pruning margin from `staticEval+100+lmrDepth*100` to `staticEval+80+lmrDepth*80`. More aggressive pruning of quiet moves that can't reach alpha.
- **Result**: **H1 accepted, +33.6 Elo** ±27.2 in ~300 games. W72-L52-D133 (53.9%). LOS 99.2%. LLR 3.0.
- **Commit**: ec9d8fa
- **Notes**: Tenth win! Previous attempt at 120+d*120 (loosening) failed, confirming the optimum is in the tighter direction. This is the opposite of our usual pattern ("per-move pruning needs slack") — futility uses estimated LMR depth which provides its own slack. Consider testing 60+d*60 to bracket further.

### QS Two-Sided Delta Pruning (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: Add "good-delta" early return in QS: when standPat + captureValue - 240 >= beta AND SEE is positive, return beta immediately. Complement to existing "bad-delta" (skip captures that can't reach alpha).
- **Result**: H0 at 224 games, -37.4 Elo ±33.4, LOS 1.4%, LLR -2.96.
- **Source**: Minic (credited to Seer)
- **Notes**: The good-delta early return is too aggressive — returning beta without searching the capture misses important tactical complications. Our existing bad-delta + QS beta blending already handles the QS boundary well.

### TT Noisy Move Detection (H1 — MERGED)
- **Change**: Detect when the TT best move is a capture (`ttMoveNoisy := ttMove != NoMove && b.Squares[ttMove.To()] != Empty`). When true, add +1 LMR reduction for quiet moves — if the best known move is tactical, quiet alternatives deserve extra skepticism.
- **Result**: H1 at 304 games, +34.4 Elo ±27.4, LOS 99.3%, LLR 3.02.
- **Baseline**: ec9d8fa (futility 80+d*80)
- **Commit**: 330dcd4
- **Source**: Obsidian, Berserk
- **Notes**: Eleventh SPRT win from engine reviews! Simple 2-line idea with massive payoff. The insight is that when the position's best move is a capture, the position is likely tactical and quiet moves are less relevant — so reduce them more aggressively. This is a form of position-aware LMR that leverages TT information.

### Aspiration Fail-High Depth Reduction (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: In the aspiration window loop, add `depth--` when the search fails high. Intent: make re-searches cheaper after fail-high by reducing the search depth.
- **Result**: H0 at 26 games, -353.8 Elo ±166.9, LOS 0.0%, LLR -3.09. Catastrophic.
- **Baseline**: ec9d8fa (futility 80+d*80)
- **Source**: 5 engines (but implementation was wrong)
- **Notes**: Bug: `depth--` modified the outer iterative deepening loop variable, permanently reducing search depth for the rest of the game. Correct implementation would use a separate `searchDepth` variable inside the aspiration loop. Not worth retesting — the correct version would need careful scoping and the gain is likely marginal.

### 4-Ply Continuation History (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: Add `contHistPtr4` from 4 plies ago (our own move 2 full moves back) at quarter weight (1/4) in both history pruning and LMR history scoring. Read-only — no updates to the 4-ply table.
- **Result**: H0 at 303 games, -25.3 Elo ±27.7, LOS 3.7%, LLR -3.04.
- **Baseline**: 330dcd4 (TT-noisy merged)
- **Source**: 10 engines (Berserk, Stormphrax, RubiChess, Caissa, Seer, Weiss, Obsidian, BlackMarlin, Altair, Reckless)
- **Notes**: Despite massive engine consensus (10 engines), this hurts for us. The 4-ply lookback is too distant — the position has changed too much for the correlation to be useful. Our 1-ply and 2-ply continuation history are sufficient. May work better if writes to ply-4 are also done (Obsidian writes at half bonus), but the read-only approach is clearly negative. The 1/4 weight may also be wrong — some engines use equal weight for all plies.

### NMP Less Reduction After Captures (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: In NMP, reduce R by 1 when the previous move was a capture (`b.UndoStack[last].Captured != Empty → R--`). Rationale: captures change the position significantly, making NMP riskier.
- **Result**: H0 at 668 games, -8.3 Elo ±18.3, LOS 18.7%, LLR -3.04.
- **Baseline**: 330dcd4 (TT-noisy merged)
- **Source**: Tucano
- **Notes**: Our NMP is already well-calibrated for post-capture positions. The R-1 after captures makes NMP too conservative, losing the time savings without compensating accuracy gain.

### Cutnode LMR +2 (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: Extra LMR reduction at cut nodes increased from +1 to +2. `if beta-alpha == 1 && moveCount > 1 { reduction += 2 }` (was `+= 1`).
- **Result**: H0 at 1930 games, +0.5 Elo ±10.8, LOS 53.9%, LLR -2.93.
- **Baseline**: 330dcd4 (TT-noisy merged)
- **Source**: Weiss (+2), Obsidian, BlackMarlin
- **Notes**: Dead flat after 1930 games. Our existing +1 cut-node reduction is correctly calibrated. +2 is too aggressive — it over-reduces at expected cut nodes, losing tactical accuracy. Despite 3-engine consensus for +2, our engine's LMR tables (C=1.50 quiet / C=1.80 capture) already provide sufficient reduction at cut nodes.

### Cutoff-Count Child Feedback (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: Track beta cutoffs at child nodes. Added `ChildCutoffs [MaxPly+1]int` to SearchInfo, reset at node entry, increment parent's counter on beta cutoff. In quiet LMR: `if info.ChildCutoffs[ply] > 2 { reduction++ }`.
- **Result**: H0 at 1294 games, -1.6 Elo ±13.1, LOS 40.5%, LLR -2.96.
- **Baseline**: 330dcd4 (TT-noisy merged)
- **Source**: Reckless (cutoff_count > 2 → reduction += 1604)
- **Notes**: Dead flat. The child cutoff count doesn't provide useful signal for parent LMR. Many children cutting off is ambiguous — it could mean many refutations exist (bad position) or many moves are obviously losing (clear best move). The signal is too noisy to improve on existing LMR heuristics.

### "Failing" Heuristic — Position Deterioration (H1 — MERGED)
- **Change**: Detect significant eval deterioration: `failing = staticEval < eval2pliesAgo - (60 + 40*depth)`. When failing: +1 LMR reduction for quiet moves, tighten LMP limit to 2/3. Complements the existing `improving` flag by detecting the opposite — positions getting much worse.
- **Result**: **H1 at 355 games, +29.4 Elo ±25.3, LOS 98.9%, LLR 2.95.** Fast convergence.
- **Baseline**: 330dcd4 (TT-noisy merged)
- **Source**: Altair (failing flag → +1 LMR, tighter LMP divider)
- **Commit**: (pending merge)
- **Notes**: Twelfth engine-review win! Same "search progress feedback" family as alpha-reduce (+13.0). When the position is deteriorating significantly, our moves are being refuted — reduce and prune more aggressively. The depth-scaled threshold (60+40*d) ensures the bar for "failing" rises with depth, avoiding false positives at deep nodes.

### Futility History Gate (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: Exempt moves with combined history > 12000 from futility pruning. Computed `combinedHist = mainHistory + contHist + contHist2/2` before MakeMove, added `combinedHist <= 12000` condition to futility pruning block.
- **Result**: H0 at 600 games, -9.8 Elo ±19.5, LOS 16.1%, LLR -3.00.
- **Baseline**: 05aee22 (failing heuristic merged)
- **Source**: Igel (history + cmhist + fmhist < fpHistoryLimit[improving])
- **Notes**: Clearly negative. Futility pruning's eval-based gate is already well-calibrated — adding a history exemption allows bad moves through. History is already used in LMR and history pruning; double-dipping in futility is redundant and harmful. Consistent with earlier finding that history-aware futility margins lose Elo (-6.0 in 2026-03-12 experiment).

### NMP Divisor 170 (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: Reduce NMP depth divisor from 200 to 170 (more aggressive null-move pruning via deeper reductions). `depth - depth/170 - 4` instead of `depth - depth/200 - 4`.
- **Result**: H0 at 3963 games, +2.7 Elo ±7.7, LOS 75.5%, LLR -2.96. SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 05aee22 (failing heuristic merged)
- **Notes**: Long grind to rejection. The +2.7 Elo is in the noise band — NMP divisor 200 is well-calibrated. Combined with the earlier NMP-240 rejection (-3.2 Elo), both directions lose, confirming 200 is optimal. Do not revisit NMP divisor.

### Alpha-Raised Aspiration Window (H1 — MERGED)
- **Change**: After alpha-side aspiration failure, raise alpha to `max(alpha, bestScore - delta/2)` instead of `alpha - delta`. This prevents alpha from collapsing too far on a single fail-low, giving tighter search windows on the retry.
- **Result**: **H1 at 3519 games, +7.5 Elo ±8.0, LOS 96.7%, LLR 3.00.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 05aee22 (failing heuristic merged)
- **Source**: Engine review — Altair aspiration window management
- **Notes**: Thirteenth engine-review win! Same "score dampening" family as TT-dampen (+22.1) and FH-blend (+14.7). Pattern confirmed: score dampening at noisy boundaries has 80% win rate. The key insight is that a single fail-low doesn't mean the true score is far below alpha — raising alpha prevents wasted work on overly wide windows.

### History-Based Extensions (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: Extend +1 ply when both contHist[0] and contHist[1] are >= 10000 (Igel pattern). Applied only to quiet, non-check moves at depth >= 6.
- **Result**: H0 at 1443 games, -1.2 Elo ±12.7, LOS 42.6%, LLR -2.95. SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 05aee22 (failing heuristic merged)
- **Source**: Igel (extend when continuation histories both high)
- **Notes**: Dead flat. Continuation history values >= 10000 are too rare to trigger frequently enough to matter, and when they do trigger, the position is likely already well-searched. Extensions based on history don't add signal beyond what singular extensions already provide. Consistent with the general finding that history-aware modifications beyond LMR have low success rate (8%).

### Threat-Aware LMR: Pawn Threat Escape (H1 — MERGED)
- **Change**: Compute enemy pawn attacks at each node. In LMR, reduce less (reduction--) when moving a piece away from a pawn-attacked square. The logic: escaping a pawn threat is a purposeful move that deserves deeper search.
- **Result**: **H1 at 951 games, +14.6 Elo ±15.7, LOS 96.6%, LLR 2.99.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 0c1e716 (progressive alpha-raised merged)
- **Source**: Engine review — threat-aware history (12-engine consensus). Simplified to LMR-only adjustment using pawn threats.
- **Notes**: Fourteenth engine-review win! First structural innovation from the next-phase plan. Pawn attacks are cheap to compute (two bitboard shifts + OR). The signal is strong because pieces under pawn attack genuinely need to move, and reducing less on those escape moves prevents overlooking critical tactics. This lighter approach (LMR adjustment only) captured the key benefit without the complexity of a full 4x indexed history table.

### Node-Based Time Management — Aggressive (H0 — rejected)
- **Change**: Track best move's share of root nodes per iteration. Scale soft time limit: >0.9 fraction → 0.6x, >0.8 → 0.75x, <0.2 → 1.6x, <0.4 → 1.3x. More aggressive thresholds than the earlier conservative attempt (+2 Elo, flat).
- **Result**: H0 at 903 games, -4.6 Elo ±15.8, LOS 28.3%, LLR -2.97. SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 0c1e716 (progressive alpha-raised merged)
- **Source**: Next-phase plan item #4 (retry with aggressive scaling)
- **Notes**: Both conservative (flat) and aggressive (negative) node-fraction TM have failed. The issue may be that at 10+0.1 time controls, there aren't enough root nodes per iteration for the fraction to be meaningful. Also, the interaction with existing stability-based TM may be redundant — both try to measure "how confident are we in the best move." Do not revisit node-fraction TM.

### IIR Extra on PV Nodes (inconclusive — killed for net upgrade)
- **Change**: Extra IIR reduction at PV nodes without TT move: depth reduced by 2 instead of 1. `if beta-alpha > 1 { depth-- }` inside IIR block.
- **Result**: Killed at 2102 games, +8.1 Elo ±10.2, LOS 94.0%, LLR 2.28 (77% toward H1). SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 0c1e716 (progressive alpha-raised merged)
- **Source**: Altair (IIR extra at PV)
- **Notes**: Was trending strongly toward H1 when killed for net upgrade. Re-test with new net — likely a real +5-8 Elo gain.

### SEE Quiet Threshold -20d² → -25d² (inconclusive — killed for net upgrade)
- **Change**: Tighter SEE quiet pruning threshold from -20*depth*depth to -25*depth*depth.
- **Result**: Killed at 1819 games, +2.5 Elo ±10.9, LOS 67.4%, LLR -1.61. SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 0c1e716 (progressive alpha-raised merged)
- **Notes**: Flat — was trending toward H0. Low priority for re-test.

### Threat-Aware LMP (killed — clearly negative)
- **Change**: Tighten LMP limit to 3/4 for quiet moves that don't escape a pawn-attacked square. Uses the enemyPawnAttacks bitboard from threat-aware LMR.
- **Result**: Killed at 386 games, -11.0 Elo ±24.7, LOS 19.2%, LLR -2.01. SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 8d6f19d (threat-aware LMR merged)
- **Notes**: Clearly negative. Tightening LMP based on threat status prunes too aggressively — many good quiet moves don't involve escaping threats. The threat signal works for LMR (search shallower) but not LMP (skip entirely). Do not revisit.

### Non-Pawn Correction History with Zobrist (killed — negative)
- **Change**: Added second correction history table indexed by `(hash ^ pawnHash) % corrHistSize` to capture piece-placement eval errors. Blended 2:1 with pawn correction (2/3 pawn + 1/3 non-pawn).
- **Result**: Killed at 367 games, -9.7 Elo ±24.5, LOS 22.0%, LLR -1.87. SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 8d6f19d (threat-aware LMR merged)
- **Source**: Next-phase plan item #3 (correction history retry with Zobrist keys)
- **Notes**: Negative. The non-pawn Zobrist key changes too frequently (every piece move) to build reliable correction statistics. The pawn hash works because pawn structure is stable — adding a volatile key dilutes the signal. Third correction history variant to fail. The pawn-hash-only approach is correct for our engine.

### Threat-Aware RFP (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Widen RFP margin by 30cp per non-pawn piece under enemy pawn attack. When our pieces are threatened, the position is more volatile, so require a bigger eval surplus before pruning.
- **Result**: **H0 at 402 games, -15.6 Elo ±22.8, LOS 9.1%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: b6ab0c9 (net v3 merged)
- **Notes**: Widening the RFP margin for threatened positions makes it harder to prune, wasting search effort on nodes that should be cut. The base RFP margins are already well-calibrated — adding threat-based adjustments just makes them worse. Third threat-signal extension to fail (after threat-LMP and threat-futility). The threat signal is only useful for LMR modulation.

### Threat-Aware Futility Pruning (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Exempt moves that escape enemy pawn threats from futility pruning. If a quiet move's from-square is under pawn attack but to-square is not, skip the futility check.
- **Result**: **H0 at 195 games, -35.8 Elo ±32.8, LOS 1.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: b6ab0c9 (net v3 merged)
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. Exempting threat-escaping moves from futility pruning allows too many low-value moves through — most "escapes" aren't tactically important enough to justify the search cost. Similar lesson to threat-LMP: the threat signal is only useful for *modulating* search depth (LMR), not for *bypassing* pruning entirely.

### IIR Extra Reduction for PV Nodes (REJECTED)
- **Change**: When IIR triggers (no TT move, depth >= 4), apply an additional `depth--` for PV nodes. Theory: PV nodes without a TT move are especially suspect and benefit from deeper reduction.
- **Result**: **H0 at 825 games, -5.5 Elo ±16.5, LOS 25.8%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x merged)
- **Notes**: PV nodes need full depth more than other node types — they're on the principal variation. Extra IIR reduction loses the engine's ability to find good continuations. Combined with earlier IIR-deep2 failures, extra IIR beyond a single depth reduction is harmful.

### LMR Check Reduction (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Instead of skipping LMR for check-giving moves (`!givesCheck`), allow checks into LMR but give them `reduction--`. Theory: checks are important but not so important they should skip LMR entirely.
- **Result**: **H0 at 362 games, -16.3 Elo ±23.4, LOS 8.6%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x merged)
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. Checks deserve full LMR skip — they're tactical by nature and reducing them loses critical tactics. This aligns with the check extension failure (-11.2 Elo): the current "skip LMR for checks" is the correct calibration.

### NNUE Net v3: 113M Positions (MERGED)
- **Change**: New NNUE net trained from scratch on 112.7M positions (vs 70M for previous net). Includes ~1M "drunken" positions from games with blunders. 3-stage LR schedule: 0.01×8ep → 0.003×4ep → 0.001×4ep. Val loss: 0.127 (vs ~0.133 for old net).
- **Result**: **H1 at 216 games, +56.8 Elo ±37.2, LOS 99.9%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15. Tested on separate 32-thread machine.
- **Notes**: Biggest single Elo gain ever. Data volume (1.6x) was the key driver — suggests returns on data are far from exhausted. Low draw ratio (36.6%) indicates the net finds wins the old net couldn't. Priority should shift to data scaling for future gains.

### Correction History with Zobrist Keys v2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Second attempt at correction history using `(hash ^ pawnHash) % corrHistSize` as the non-pawn key. Separate table blended with pawn correction.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1385 games, -1.3 Elo ±12.5, LOS 42.2%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x merged)
- **Notes**: Third correction history variant to fail (XOR bitboards: -11.8, Zobrist killed at -9.7, Zobrist v2: -1.3). The pawn-hash-only approach is correct for our engine. Non-pawn keys change too frequently to build reliable correction statistics. Do not revisit correction history unless the approach fundamentally changes (e.g., per-color separate tables, continuation-indexed).

### ContHist2 Updates on Cutoff/Penalty v2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Add contHistPtr2 (2-ply continuation history) to bonus/penalty updates on beta cutoffs and failed quiets. Second attempt.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1331 games, -1.3 Elo ±12.7, LOS 42.0%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x merged)
- **Notes**: Second attempt, same result as first (-7.5 Elo). The 2-ply continuation history signal is inherently too weak for reliable learning — the piece at ply-2 may have been captured, making the key stale. Read-only at half weight for LMR/pruning remains the correct approach. Do not revisit.

### ProbCut MVV-LVA Ordering (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Add MVV-LVA + captHist scoring with incremental selection sort to ProbCut capture iteration. Previously captures were iterated in generation order after SEE filter.
- **Result**: **H0 at 474 games, -13.2 Elo ±21.8, LOS 11.8%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x merged)
- **Notes**: ProbCut already filters by SEE >= margin, leaving very few captures (~2-3). Sorting overhead outweighs any ordering benefit. The SEE filter is sufficient — the first passing capture is almost always the best. Do not revisit.

### Hindsight Reduction/Bonus (REJECTED)
- **Change**: After LMR re-search, adjust newDepth based on eval trajectory. When reduction >= 2: if staticEval + parentEval > 0 (improving), newDepth++; if < 0 (declining), newDepth--. Stormphrax/Berserk/Tucano pattern.
- **Result**: **H0 at 198 games, -35.2 Elo ±32.3, LOS 1.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: engine-notes/SUMMARY.md #8, 4 engines
- **Notes**: Strongly negative despite 4-engine consensus. The eval sum heuristic may be too crude — staticEval + parentEval doesn't account for tempo or captures between plies. Also, the newDepth-- path (reduce further when declining) may over-prune positions where the engine needs to search harder to find a defense. Could retry with only the extension path (no reduction), or with a larger threshold than 0.

### IIR in PV at Depth 2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Apply Internal Iterative Reduction in PV nodes at depth >= 2 (previously only non-PV). When no TT move found in PV, reduce depth by 1.
- **Result**: **H0 at 825 games, -5.5 Elo ±16.5, LOS 25.8%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x merged)
- **Notes**: PV nodes without a TT move are rare and usually important positions where the engine needs full depth. Reducing depth here causes the PV to miss critical moves. IIR is correct for non-PV (saves search on unimportant lines) but harmful in PV. Second test of this idea (also -5.5 Elo at different bounds). Do not revisit.

### Opponent-Threats Guard on RFP (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Skip Reverse Futility Pruning when the opponent has a threatening move (detected via null move or TT). Prevents over-pruning in tactical positions.
- **Result**: **H0 at 402 games, -15.6 Elo ±22.8, LOS 9.1%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: engine-notes/SUMMARY.md, Berserk/Minic pattern
- **Notes**: The guard was triggered too frequently, effectively disabling RFP in many positions. RFP's margin already accounts for tactical risk implicitly. Adding explicit threat detection on top creates redundancy and loses efficiency. Guards against over-pruning work when they're rare (like our NMP threat bonus at +12.4 Elo) but not when they fire broadly.

### Opponent-Threats Guard on Futility (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Skip futility pruning when the opponent has a threatening move. Similar approach to Threat-RFP but applied to futility pruning gate.
- **Result**: **H0 at 195 games, -35.8 Elo ±32.8, LOS 1.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: engine-notes/SUMMARY.md, Berserk/Minic pattern
- **Notes**: Even worse than Threat-RFP. Futility pruning is the engine's most aggressive quiet-move pruning and disabling it for threats causes massive search tree explosion. The futility margin (100+d*100) is already well-calibrated. Threat-based guards on pruning are consistently negative for our engine — do not revisit this pattern.

### Finny Tables — NNUE Accumulator Cache (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Per-perspective, per-king-bucket accumulator cache (`[2][16]FinnyEntry`). On king bucket change, diff cached vs current features using sorted merge (O(n)) and apply deltas (~5 ops) instead of full recompute (~30 ops). Fast path (no cache hit) has zero overhead — identical to original code.
- **Result**: **H0 at 702 games, -6.9 Elo ±17.6, LOS 22.0%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 4bbcb7d (conthist 3x merged)
- **Notes**: NPS gain was +0.5-1.5% in benchmarks but didn't translate to Elo. Early SPRT was misleadingly positive (+20.6 at 236 games). King bucket changes are rare enough that caching doesn't fire often, and when it does the accuracy of the diff'd accumulator may be slightly worse than a clean recompute due to int16 accumulation error. Not worth the complexity. Could revisit if architecture scales to 2x512+ where recompute cost is higher.

### ProbCut QS Pre-Filter (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Inside ProbCut capture loop, call quiescence search before the reduced-depth negamax. If QS already exceeds the ProbCut beta threshold, skip the expensive reduced-depth search entirely.
- **Result**: **H0 at 177 games, -35.5 Elo ±32.6, LOS 1.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: Tucano pattern, experiment_queue Tier 1 #3
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. QS is not a reliable filter for ProbCut — the QS score can differ significantly from the reduced-depth search score because QS only considers captures while ProbCut's reduced search also evaluates quiet moves. Using QS as a cheap pre-filter causes ProbCut to fire on positions where the full search would not confirm the cutoff, leading to incorrect pruning. The existing ProbCut implementation (reduced-depth search only) is correct.

### Recapture Depth Reduction (REJECTED)
- **Change**: When `!improving` and `staticEval + bestCaptureValue < alpha`, reduce depth by 1 before the main search. Theory: if our eval plus the best available capture still can't reach alpha, the position is hopeless and we can search shallowly.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1197 games, -2.4 Elo ±13.7, LOS 36.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: Tucano pattern, experiment_queue Tier 1 #2
- **Notes**: Flat-to-slightly-negative over ~1200 games. The condition fires in positions where the engine is already losing, so reducing depth there doesn't save meaningful time — those nodes are typically cut quickly by other pruning (RFP, futility, LMP). The depth reduction also risks missing tactical escapes in losing positions. Not harmful but not helpful either.

### Score-Drop Time Extension — Aggressive Sigmoid (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Replaced conservative time management scaling (1.4x/1.2x for score drops >50/>25) with aggressive Tucano-inspired scaling: 2.5x/2.0x/1.5x for drops ≥60/≥40/≥20. Also added score-stability tracking (3+ consecutive iterations with Δ≤10 → scale 0.7x to save time).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1539 games, -0.5 Elo ±11.7, LOS 46.9%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: Tucano pattern, experiment_queue Tier 1 #1
- **Notes**: Dead flat over 1500+ games. The more aggressive time allocation on score drops doesn't help because: (1) at 10+0.1s TC, the extra time from 2.5x scaling is still small in absolute terms, (2) the engine's existing TM already handles instability via best-move stability and the 1.4x scaling, (3) the 0.7x stable-score reduction may counteract the extensions. Our existing TM is well-calibrated for this TC. Aggressive time extension might help at longer TCs (60+0.6s) where the absolute time gain is larger.

### Fail-High Extra Reduction at Cut-Nodes (REJECTED)
- **Change**: In LMR, add `reduction++` when `staticEval - 200 > beta`. Theory: if static eval exceeds beta by 200+ centipawns, we're very likely to get a cutoff and can search more shallowly.
- **Result**: **H0 at 955 games, -4.0 Elo ±15.1, LOS 30.1%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: Minic pattern, experiment_queue Tier 1 #4
- **Notes**: Slightly negative. The engine already has effective cut-node handling via NMP (which prunes entire subtrees when eval >> beta) and RFP (which prunes at shallow depths). Adding an extra LMR reduction on top is redundant — the positions where eval-200 > beta are already being aggressively pruned. The extra reduction only fires on the few moves that survive other pruning, and reducing those further loses important tactical verification.

### Complexity-Adjusted LMR (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Compute `complexity = abs(staticEval - rawEval)` (correction history magnitude). When `complexity > 50`, reduce LMR by 1 (search more deeply in uncertain positions).
- **Result**: **H0 at 530 games, -11.2 Elo ±20.5, LOS 14.2%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: Obsidian pattern, experiment_queue Tier 2 #6
- **Notes**: Clearly negative. Reducing LMR in "complex" positions (high correction magnitude) fires too broadly and increases the search tree significantly without finding better moves. The correction history magnitude is not a reliable indicator of tactical complexity — it may be large due to positional evaluation errors that don't affect move ordering. LMR reductions are well-calibrated; blanket reduction decreases based on eval uncertainty are harmful.

### Opponent Material LMR (MERGED)
- **Change**: In LMR, add `reduction++` when opponent has fewer than 2 non-pawn pieces. In simplified endgame-like positions, there's less tactical potential, so quiet moves can be searched more shallowly.
- **Result**: **H1 at 742 games, +18.5 Elo ±18.5, LOS 97.4%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged)
- **Source**: Weiss pattern, experiment_queue Tier 2 #7
- **Notes**: Strong result. When the opponent has ≤1 non-pawn piece, the position is simplified enough that quiet move alternatives are even less likely to be best — the engine can afford to search them more shallowly. This is a clean, principled LMR adjustment: material count is a reliable proxy for tactical complexity, unlike correction-history-based complexity measures which fire too broadly. Consider testing the opposite direction (reduction-- when opponent has many pieces) as a follow-up.

### Castling Bonus in Quiet Scoring (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Add a small bonus (+10) to quiet move scoring for castling moves, encouraging the move picker to try castling earlier in the quiet move ordering.
- **Result**: **H0 at 567 games, -9.8 Elo ±19.7, LOS 16.4%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged, pre-opp-material merge)
- **Source**: move_ordering_backlog, low-priority idea
- **Notes**: Clearly negative. Castling is already handled well by the existing move ordering (history heuristic, PST). Adding a fixed bonus disrupts the learned ordering and can cause castling to be tried before more relevant quiet moves. The move picker's history-based approach is superior to static bonuses for non-forcing moves.

### Opponent High-Material LMR Reduction-- (REJECTED)
- **Change**: In LMR, add `reduction--` when opponent has ≥4 non-pawn pieces. The complement to the merged opp-material LMR (reduction++ when oppNonPawn < 2): search quiet moves more deeply when the opponent has many pieces (higher tactical complexity).
- **Result**: **H0 at 307 games, -24.9 Elo ±27.5, LOS 3.8%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: opp-material-LMR merged (main + reduction++ for oppNonPawn < 2)
- **Source**: Follow-up to Opponent Material LMR (Tier 2 #7)
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. Reducing LMR in complex positions (many opponent pieces) massively increases the search tree. The existing LMR reduction table is well-calibrated for normal material counts — decreasing reductions broadly when the opponent has 4+ pieces causes too many quiet moves to be searched deeply, wasting time on irrelevant alternatives. The asymmetry makes sense: pruning MORE in simple positions (few pieces) is safe because there are fewer tactics, but pruning LESS in complex positions doesn't find better moves — it just searches more junk. The opp-material LMR benefit is one-directional.

### Complexity-Aware RFP (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Use correction history magnitude as a complexity proxy in Reverse Futility Pruning margin. When `abs(correctedEval - rawEval) > 50`, widen the RFP margin by 30cp (require more margin to prune in uncertain positions).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1907 games, +0.5 Elo ±10.8, LOS 54.0%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged, pre-opp-material merge)
- **Source**: Stormphrax pattern, experiment_queue Tier 2 #5
- **Notes**: Dead flat over nearly 2000 games. The correction history magnitude doesn't provide useful signal for RFP margin adjustment. The existing RFP margin (85cp + 60cp×depth) is well-calibrated and the correction history correction already implicitly handles eval uncertainty by adjusting staticEval directly. Adding a second layer of uncertainty-based margin widening is redundant — the corrected eval already accounts for the positional patterns that correction history captures. RFP margins are fully bracketed.

### Bad Noisy Futility (MERGED)
- **Change**: Separate futility pruning for losing captures (SEE < 0). At depth ≤ 4, when `staticEval + depth*50 <= alpha` and the capture has negative SEE, prune it (unless it gives check). The SEE call is gated behind the cheap eval guard so it's only computed when the position already looks futile.
- **Result**: **H1 at 1295 games, +11.8 Elo ±13.2, LOS 96.0%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged, pre-opp-material merge)
- **Source**: Reckless pattern, experiment_queue Tier 2 #8
- **Notes**: Strong result. Losing captures that don't even bring eval close to alpha are pure waste — they lose material AND the position is already bad. The existing futility pruning only covers quiets; this extends the concept to bad captures. The `depth*50` margin is tight (vs `80+80*depth` for quiet futility) because captures have a known material exchange that SEE evaluates. Guards: not in check, not TT move, not promotion, has bestScore, doesn't give check. The cheap eval guard prevents unnecessary SEE calls in most positions.

### CMP/FMP — Per-Component Continuation History Pruning (REJECTED)
- **Change**: In the history pruning section (depth ≤ 3), add per-component continuation history pruning: prune quiet moves when individual `contHist[piece][to] < -3000` or `contHist2[piece][to] < -3000`, even if the combined history score is above threshold.
- **Result**: **H0 at 303 games, -21.8 Elo ±26.1, LOS 5.1%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 1c7bdc8 (code review fixes merged, pre-opp-material merge)
- **Source**: Igel pattern, experiment_queue Tier 3 (CMP/FMP)
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. Per-component pruning is too aggressive — individual continuation history components can be deeply negative for a specific piece-to pair while the combined score (main history + contHist + contHist2) is positive, indicating the move is still worth searching. Pruning based on a single negative component throws away moves that other history signals support. The combined-score approach in our existing history pruning (threshold: -2000×depth) is the correct granularity. Confirms the pattern: history-based pruning modifications have a ~8% success rate for our engine.

### Opponent Material LMR Threshold 3 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Widen the opponent material LMR threshold from `oppNonPawn < 2` to `oppNonPawn < 3`. With fewer than 3 non-pawn pieces (i.e. 0-2 pieces), the position is simplified enough to increase LMR reduction.
- **Result**: **H1 at 624 games, +18.4 Elo ±18.3, LOS 97.5%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 705911f (opp-material < 2 + bad-noisy merged)
- **Source**: Bracket test of merged Opponent Material LMR
- **Notes**: Another strong result from widening the threshold. The < 2 condition only fires in deep endgames (lone piece); < 3 fires much more often (e.g. rook + minor vs similar). The broader application still works because positions with ≤2 non-pawn opponent pieces genuinely have reduced tactical complexity. Consider testing < 4 as a further bracket, though diminishing returns are likely as the condition approaches normal middlegame material counts.

### Own-Side Low Material LMR (REJECTED)
- **Change**: In LMR, add `reduction++` when the side to move has fewer than 2 non-pawn pieces. Symmetric counterpart to the opponent material LMR — if we're simplified too, reduce more.
- **Result**: **H0 at 316 games, -18.7 Elo ±24.8, LOS 7.0%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 705911f (opp-material < 2 + bad-noisy merged)
- **Source**: Follow-up to Opponent Material LMR
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. The asymmetry makes sense: when the *opponent* has few pieces, *their* threats are limited so we can reduce our quiet moves. But when *we* have few pieces, we need to search carefully to find the best use of our limited material — reducing our own moves in this situation loses critical accuracy. The signal is one-directional: opponent material count predicts opponent threat level, not our own move quality.

### Bad Noisy Futility Margin 75 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Loosen the bad-noisy futility margin from `staticEval + depth*50 <= alpha` to `staticEval + depth*75 <= alpha`. The wider gate allows more losing captures to be pruned.
- **Result**: **H1 at 131 games, +58.9 Elo ±38.0, LOS 99.9%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 705911f (opp-material < 2 + bad-noisy merged)
- **Source**: Bracket test of merged Bad Noisy Futility
- **Notes**: Massive result — the original depth*50 margin was too conservative. With depth*75, the pruning fires much more frequently (a depth-4 capture is pruned when eval is 300cp below alpha instead of 200cp). Losing captures in positions that are 300cp below alpha are overwhelmingly futile. The SEE guard still ensures we only prune material-losing captures, so the wider eval gate is safe. Consider testing depth*100 as a further bracket.

### Texel-Tuned Classical Eval (MERGED)
- **Change**: All PST, eval, and pawn structure parameters optimized via Texel tuning on 125M positions (depth-10 rescored). ~1268 parameters updated.
- **Result**: **H1 at 314 games, +33.3 Elo ±27.1, LOS 99.2%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: Current main (classical mode, `arg=-classical`)
- **Source**: Texel tuner with Adam optimizer, 500 epochs, lambda=0.5
- **Notes**: First complete Texel tune from the large rescored dataset. The classical eval was using manually-tuned PeSTO values; the optimized parameters are better calibrated. Changes are small per-square adjustments across all piece types and pawn structure bonuses, not structural changes. This gain is orthogonal to NNUE (only affects classical play and training data generation). The .tbin cache must be regenerated after this merge.

### Bad Noisy Depth 6 — NOT DIRECTLY COMPARABLE
- **Change**: Extend bad-noisy from depth≤4 to depth≤6, with margin depth*50 (vs current depth*75 at depth≤4).
- **Result**: **H1 at 281 games, +37.2 Elo ±29.1, LOS 99.4%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: Pre-M75 merge base (old worktree). NOT directly comparable to current main.
- **Source**: Pre-merge bracket test
- **Notes**: Tested against an older baseline before the depth*75 merge. The current main has depth≤4/margin*75, while this tested depth≤6/margin*50 against the old depth≤4/margin*50 base. The +37.2 Elo gain is vs that old base, not vs current. Worth retesting depth≤6/margin*75 against current main to see if extending the depth range adds further value on top of the wider margin.

### Bad Noisy Margin depth*100 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Widen bad-noisy futility margin from `depth*75` to `depth*100`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 167 games, -37.6 Elo ±33.6, LOS 1.5%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: d82ab70 (Texel-tuned eval + BINP reader)
- **Source**: Bracket test of merged bad-noisy margin
- **Notes**: Too aggressive. At depth 4, this prunes captures when eval is 400cp below alpha — too wide, catching captures that actually have tactical merit. The optimum is confirmed at depth*75. Don't test wider.

### Failing Heuristic in Capture LMR (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Add `if failing { reduction++ }` to the capture LMR block, matching the quiet LMR adjustment.
- **Result**: **H0 at 292 games, -22.6 Elo ±26.9, LOS 5.0%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: d82ab70 (Texel-tuned eval + BINP reader)
- **Source**: Capture LMR asymmetry analysis
- **Notes**: The failing signal doesn't transfer to captures. When the position is deteriorating, quiets deserve more reduction (they're unlikely to save us), but captures remain tactically relevant — even in collapsing positions, a good capture can change the evaluation. The asymmetry between quiet and capture LMR is intentional, not a gap.

### TT-Noisy in Capture LMR (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Add `if ttMoveNoisy { reduction++ }` to capture LMR, matching quiet LMR's +1 reduction when TT move is a capture.
- **Result**: **H0 at 261 games, -29.4 Elo ±29.5, LOS 2.6%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 46122f5 (SF binpack filter fix)
- **Source**: Capture LMR asymmetry analysis
- **Notes**: Third capture LMR extension rejected (after failing flag -22.6, now ttMoveNoisy -29.4). The pattern is clear: quiet LMR adjustments do NOT transfer to capture LMR. When the TT move is a capture, other captures remain tactically important — reducing them loses critical lines. The capture LMR table with capture history is the right granularity; adding coarser signals hurts.

### Bad Noisy Depth 6 vs Current Main (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Extend bad-noisy from `depth <= 4` to `depth <= 6`, keeping margin `depth*75`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1460 games, -1.0 Elo ±12.2, LOS 43.9%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 46122f5 (current main with depth≤4/margin*75)
- **Notes**: Dead flat. The depth≤4 threshold is optimal — deeper bad-noisy catches too few additional positions to matter. The earlier +37.2 vs old base was measuring the margin change, not the depth change.

### Opponent Material LMR Threshold <4 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Widen from `oppNonPawn < 3` to `oppNonPawn < 4`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 2710 games, +1.9 Elo ±8.8, LOS 66.6%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 46122f5
- **Notes**: Very long test, very flat. Threshold <3 is optimal. <4 includes too many normal middlegame positions where the reduction is inappropriate.

### FH Blend Depth Gate 2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Lower FH blend depth gate from `depth >= 3` to `depth >= 2`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1280 games, -1.4 Elo ±12.7, LOS 41.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 46122f5
- **Notes**: Flat. Depth-2 FH is too close to QS where beta blending already operates. The depth≥3 gate correctly separates the two dampening mechanisms.

### TT Cutoff History Bonus (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Give history bonus to TT move (quiet or capture) when TT probe causes a beta cutoff, matching Stockfish PR #5791.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1025 games, -3.1 Elo ±14.3, LOS 33.9%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 46122f5
- **Notes**: Slightly negative despite being a proven SF feature. Our persist-history fix means history tables are already well-populated across searches, reducing the value of additional TT-cutoff updates. Different engine, different optima.

### Improving-Aware Capture LMR (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Add `if improving { reduction-- }` to capture LMR, reducing less for captures in improving positions.
- **Result**: **H0 at 668 games, -6.8 Elo ±17.3, LOS 22.1%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 47f9d14
- **Source**: Capture LMR asymmetry analysis — first test reducing *less* instead of *more*
- **Notes**: Fourth capture LMR extension rejected (failing -22.6, ttMoveNoisy -29.4, now improving -6.8). Even reducing captures *less* in improving positions hurts. Capture LMR is fully self-contained — the capture history alone is the correct and only adjustment mechanism. No quiet LMR signal transfers in either direction. Stop testing capture LMR modifications.

### NMP Return Value Dampening (MERGED)
- **Change**: Blend NMP return value toward beta: `return (score*2 + beta) / 3` instead of `return beta`.
- **Result**: **H1 at 1059 games, +12.8 Elo ±14.1, LOS 96.2%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 47f9d14
- **Source**: Score dampening pattern (TT dampen +22.1, FH blend +14.7, QS blend +4.9, now NMP +12.8)
- **Notes**: Fourth score dampening win. NMP scores are noisy because the null-move assumption is approximate. Blending the return toward beta prevents inflated cutoff scores from propagating. The dampening pattern is now proven at every boundary: TT cutoffs, fail-highs, QS stand-pat, and NMP.

### Capture LMR C=1.70 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten capture LMR constant from 1.80 to 1.70 (more aggressive reduction).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1104 games, -2.5 Elo ±14.0, LOS 36.2%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 47f9d14
- **Notes**: Dead flat. C=1.80 is optimal. Capture LMR is fully calibrated.

### History Gravity Divisor 12288 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Reduce history gravity divisor from 16384 to 12288 (faster decay of old history data).
- **Result**: **H0 at 404 games, -13.8 Elo ±21.7, LOS 10.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 47f9d14
- **Notes**: Negative. Faster decay loses valuable persistent history data. D=16384 is optimal — history needs to accumulate across many searches to be reliable.

### NMP Dampening Stronger (score+beta)/2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Stronger NMP dampening: `(score+beta)/2` instead of merged `(score*2+beta)/3`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 208 games, -33.5 Elo ±31.4, LOS 1.9%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: c5bd250 (NMP dampen merged)
- **Source**: Bracket test of NMP dampening
- **Notes**: Too much dampening. The merged (score*2+beta)/3 gives 2/3 weight to score, 1/3 to beta. This variant at 1/2 each over-dampens, losing real information from the NMP score. The optimum is confirmed at (score*2+beta)/3.

### Correction History Depth Gate 2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Lower correction history depth gate from `depth >= 3` to `depth >= 2`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 277 games, -23.9 Elo ±27.0, LOS 4.2%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: c5bd250
- **Notes**: Depth-2 search results are too noisy for reliable correction updates. The depth≥3 gate correctly filters out shallow noise. D=16384 and depth≥3 are both confirmed optimal for correction history.

### Capture LMR C=1.90 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Relax capture LMR constant from 1.80 to 1.90 (less aggressive reduction).
- **Result**: **H0 at 749 games, -6.0 Elo ±16.7, LOS 24.0%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: c5bd250
- **Notes**: Capture LMR fully bracketed from both sides: C=1.70 (H0, -2.5), C=1.80 (optimal), C=1.90 (H0, -6.0). Don't retest.

### NMP Dampening Weaker (score*3+beta)/4 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Less aggressive NMP dampening: `(score*3+beta)/4` instead of merged `(score*2+beta)/3`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 825 games, -5.1 Elo ±15.9, LOS 26.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: c5bd250
- **Notes**: NMP dampening fully bracketed from both sides: (score+beta)/2 (H0, -33.5), (score*2+beta)/3 (H1, +12.8), (score*3+beta)/4 (H0, -5.1). The 2:1 ratio is optimal. Don't retest.

### TT Near-Miss Margin 80 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Widen TT near-miss cutoff margin from 64 to 80 centipawns.
- **Result**: **H1 at 570 games, +18.3 Elo ±18.5, LOS 97.4%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: c5bd250
- **Source**: Bracket test of TT near-miss margin
- **Notes**: Wider margin accepts more TT entries that are 1 ply short of the required depth. At 80cp, entries that exceed beta by 80+ cp are trusted as cutoffs. This works because large TT score margins indicate high-confidence positions where the extra ply is unlikely to change the result. Previous margin of 64 was from initial calibration and was never bracketed until now.

### TT Near-Miss Margin 112 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Widen TT near-miss margin from 80 to 112cp.
- **Result**: **H0 at 388 games, -16.1 Elo ±23.1, LOS 8.6%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d (TT near-miss 80 merged)
- **Notes**: Too wide — accepts inaccurate TT entries. Margin 80 is the optimum (64→80 gained +18.3, 80→96 trending negative, 80→112 rejected).

### QS Delta 280 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Widen QS delta pruning margin from 240 to 280.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1041 games, -3.7 Elo ±14.8, LOS 31.3%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d (TT near-miss 80 merged)
- **Notes**: QS delta 240 is optimal. Wider margin prunes too aggressively in QS. Confirmed: 200→240 gained +31.2, 240→280 rejected.

### Futility 60+d*60 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten futility margin from `80+lmrDepth*80` to `60+lmrDepth*60`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1543 games, -0.5 Elo ±11.7, LOS 47.0%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d
- **Notes**: Dead flat at 1543 games. Futility 80+d*80 is optimal. Initial +8.7 signal was noise.

### QS Delta 200 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten QS delta pruning margin from 240 to 200.
- **Result**: **H0 at 282 games, -23.4 Elo ±27.0, LOS 4.5%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d
- **Notes**: QS delta fully bracketed: 200 (H0, -23.4), 240 (optimal), 280 (H0, -3.7). Don't retest.

### RFP Tighter 85/55 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten RFP margins from depth*100/depth*70 to depth*85/depth*55.
- **Result**: **H0 at 288 games, -23.0 Elo ±26.9, LOS 4.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d
- **Notes**: RFP margins confirmed optimal at 100/70. Previous test (100→110) was also H0. Don't retest.

### ProbCut Margin 150 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten ProbCut margin from beta+170 to beta+150.
- **Result**: **H0 at 415 games, -15.1 Elo ±22.7, LOS 9.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d
- **Notes**: ProbCut margin 170 is optimal. Previous test (200→170) gained +10.0. Tighter margin prunes too aggressively.

### TT Near-Miss Margin 96 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Widen TT near-miss margin from 80 to 96cp.
- **Result**: **H0 at 2590 games, +1.6 Elo ±9.3, LOS 63.3%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d (TT near-miss 80 merged)
- **Notes**: Very long test. Early noise peaked at +7.6/91% LOS but regressed to flat. Margin 80 is optimal (64→80 gained +18.3, 80→96 flat, 80→112 rejected).

### LMR Quiet C=1.60 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Relax quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.60 (less aggressive reduction).
- **Result**: **H0 at 239 games, -29.1 Elo ±29.6, LOS 2.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d
- **Notes**: Strongly negative. Less aggressive LMR wastes search depth. The optimum is at or below 1.50 — both C=1.40 (+6.3) and C=1.30 (+26.1 early) are positive.

### LMR Quiet C=1.40 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.40.
- **Result**: **H0 at 960 games, -2.9 Elo ±14.3, LOS 34.6%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d
- **Notes**: Dead flat despite early +8.7 signal. C=1.50 confirmed from above (C=1.60 H0) and this side (C=1.40 H0). However, C=1.30 is showing +9.3 — the response may be non-monotonic or the optimum is a sharper change.

### LMR Quiet C=1.20 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.20.
- **Result**: **H0 at 826 games, -4.6 Elo ±15.7, LOS 28.1%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d
- **Notes**: Too aggressive. C=1.30 (+11.1) is the sweet spot; C=1.20 overshoots. Quiet LMR bracket: 1.20 (H0), 1.30 (building +11.1), 1.35 (+4.7), 1.40 (H0), 1.50 (current), 1.60 (H0).

### LMR Quiet C=1.30 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.30 (more aggressive reduction).
- **Result**: **H1 at 1016 games, +13.3 Elo ±14.7, LOS 96.3%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d (TT near-miss 80 merged)
- **Source**: LMR constant bracket test
- **Notes**: Continues the LMR progression: C=2.0 → 1.75 (+16.2) → 1.50 (+44.4) → 1.30 (+13.3). Perfectly bracketed: 1.25 (H0, -3.6), 1.30 (H1, +13.3), 1.35 (H0, +1.2), 1.40 (H0, -2.9). NNUE accuracy enables more aggressive reduction.

### LMR Quiet C=1.35 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.35.
- **Result**: **H0 at 2063 games, +1.2 Elo ±9.9.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.

### LMR Quiet C=1.25 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.25.
- **Result**: **H0 at 959 games, -3.6 Elo ±14.8.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.

### V5: Futility 60+d*60 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Tighten futility margin from `80+lmrDepth*80` to `60+lmrDepth*60`.
- **Result**: **H1 at 935 games, +12.3 Elo ±13.6, LOS 96.1%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 932c12c with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Was H0 (-0.5 Elo) with v4 net. V5's stronger eval allows tighter futility pruning — confirms the prediction that better eval shifts search parameter optima. First v5-specific search win.

### V5: LMR Quiet C=1.20 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR from C=1.30 to C=1.20.
- **Result**: **H0 at 167 games, -37.6 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 932c12c with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Still too aggressive even with v5. C=1.30 remains optimal.

### V5: TT Near-Miss Margin 96 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Widen TT near-miss from 80 to 96cp.
- **Result**: **H0 at 721 games, -3.9 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 932c12c with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Still flat with v5. Margin 80 confirmed optimal regardless of eval quality.

### V5: RFP Depth Gate 8 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Extend RFP depth gate from `depth <= 7` to `depth <= 8`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1377 games, -0.5 Elo ±11.9.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 16f4f02 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Completely flat. Depth 7 gate is optimal — depth 8 positions are too complex for static eval pruning even with v5.

### V5: Bad Noisy Futility Depth 6 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Extend bad noisy futility depth from `depth <= 4` to `depth <= 6`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 794 games, -5.3 Elo ±16.1.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 16f4f02 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Was flat with v4, now slightly negative with v5. Depth 4 confirmed optimal — deeper captures need full search.

### V5: LMR Quiet C=1.25 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR from C=1.30 to C=1.25.
- **Result**: **H0 at 638 games, -7.1 Elo ±17.6.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 16f4f02 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Was H0 (-3.6 Elo) with v4, now more negative with v5. C=1.30 is a hard floor.

### V5: LMR Quiet C=1.35 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Loosen quiet LMR from C=1.30 to C=1.35.
- **Result**: **H0 at 356 games, -16.6 Elo ±23.3.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 16f4f02 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Both C=1.25 and C=1.35 lose Elo — C=1.30 is precisely optimal. LMR is fully bracketed.

### V5: ProbCut Margin beta+150 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten ProbCut margin from `beta + 170` to `beta + 150`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 508 games, -10.3 Elo ±19.6.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 16f4f02 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Was H0 (-15.1 Elo) with v4, still negative with v5. beta+170 confirmed optimal across eval changes.

### V5: Razoring 350+d*80 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten razoring margin from `400 + depth*100` to `350 + depth*80`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 549 games, -9.5 Elo ±19.4.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 16f4f02 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Current razoring margins well-calibrated. Tighter margins over-prune at depth 2.

### V5: RFP Margins 90/60 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten RFP margins from `depth*100`/`depth*70` to `depth*90`/`depth*60`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 896 games, -3.5 Elo ±14.9.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 16f4f02 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Current RFP margins (100/70) already optimal for v5. Combined with depth gate test, RFP is fully tuned.

### V5: Continuation Correction History 50/50 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Add ContCorrHistory[13][64] table indexed by previous move's piece+to. Blend 50% pawn + 50% continuation correction.
- **Result**: **H0 at 645 games, -7.0 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: v5 sb120 net on main
- **Notes**: SF-proven feature (PR #5617). Too much weight on continuation correction dilutes the proven pawn correction.

### V5: Continuation Correction History 25% (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Same table but lighter blend: full pawn correction + 25% continuation correction.
- **Result**: **H0 at 938 games, -2.2 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: v5 sb120 net on main
- **Notes**: Lighter weight improved from -7 to -2.2 but still flat. Continuation correction doesn't add useful signal beyond pawn correction for our engine. The high draw ratio (63.3%) suggests over-correction.

### V5: TT Cutoff History Bonus (MERGED)
- **Change**: Give history bonus to TT move when TT probe causes a beta cutoff. Quiet moves get main history bonus, captures get capture history bonus.
- **Result**: **H1 at 810 games, +14.6 Elo ±15.5, LOS 96.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: v5 sb120 net on main
- **Notes**: Was -3.1 with v4 (H0 at 1025 games). V5's stronger eval makes TT cutoff moves more reliable — reinforcing them in history improves move ordering. First move ordering win with v5.

### V5: TT Cutoff Quiet Penalties (REJECTED)
- **Change**: On TT cutoff with quiet move, penalise killers and counter-move in history.
- **Result**: **H0 at 457 games, ~-12 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Notes**: The bonus alone (+14.6) is the right signal. Adding penalties for alternatives hurts — we don't know which moves would have been tried, so the penalties are imprecise.

### V5: TT Cutoff Counter-Move Update (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Update counter-move table when TT causes a cutoff with a quiet move.
- **Result**: **H0 at 291 games, ~-19 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Notes**: Counter-move table updates from TT cutoffs are noisy — the TT move may not be the best response to the previous move specifically.

### V5: ContHist Ply-4 Quarter Weight (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Add 4-ply continuation history lookback at quarter weight in history pruning and LMR.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1765 games, ~+1 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Notes**: Was +12.8 at 773 games (85% toward H1) then regressed to flat. Classic early noise. Was -12.4 with v4.

### V5: ContHist Ply-4 Half Weight (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Same as above but at half weight instead of quarter.
- **Result**: **H0 at 628 games, ~-7 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.

### V5: TT Cutoff ContHist Bonus (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Update continuation history when TT causes a cutoff.
- **Result**: **H0 at 782 games, ~-4 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.

### V5: NMP Verification Depth 10 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Lower NMP verification depth from 12 to 10.
- **Result**: **H0 at 647 games, ~-6 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.

### V5: Aspiration Delta 12 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighter aspiration window from delta=15 to delta=12.
- **Result**: **H0 at 459 games, ~-10 Elo.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Notes**: Delta=15 remains optimal even with v5's more stable eval.

### V5: History Pruning Depth 4 (KILLED — flat)
- **Change**: Extend history-based pruning from `depth <= 3` to `depth <= 4`.
- **Result**: Killed at 1007 games, +1.0 Elo, 56% LOS, LLR -1.7 (trending H0). SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Notes**: History pruning depth 3 is already well-calibrated. Extending to depth 4 gains nothing.

### V5: SEE Capture Pruning Depth 7 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Extend SEE capture pruning from `depth <= 6` to `depth <= 7` (margin -depth*100).
- **Result**: **H0 at 201 games, -29.5 Elo.** Decisive rejection.
- **Notes**: At depth 7, the -700 SEE threshold prunes too many captures that are tactically important. SEE capture pruning at depth <= 6 is well-calibrated.

### V5: 1536 SCReLU vs 1024 CReLU (REJECTED)
- **Change**: 1536-wide SCReLU net (multi-file 200SB, exact SIMD inference) vs 1024 CReLU baseline (120SB).
- **Result**: **H0 at 159 games, -61.8 Elo.** Decisive rejection.
- **Notes**: Despite lower training loss (0.00870 vs 0.00882), sharper piece values, and 212K NPS (only ~15% slower than CReLU), the 1536 SCReLU net was catastrophically weaker in play. Early signal (+35 at 48 games) was pure noise. The 39.6% draw ratio (vs typical 64%) suggests the net produces unbalanced evals that lead to decisive games — likely overconfident or poorly calibrated for the search.

### V5: 1536 CReLU Multi-file vs 1024 CReLU (LIKELY REJECT)
- **Change**: 1536-wide CReLU net (multi-file 200SB) vs 1024 CReLU baseline (120SB).
- **Result**: -18.5 Elo at 336 games, LLR -2.42 (82% toward H0). Still running but almost certain to reject.
- **Notes**: Consistent with earlier 1536 single-file result (-23 Elo). More data and longer training didn't help the 1536 architecture. The 1024 net is simply better calibrated for our search at current data scales.

### V5: 1536 CReLU Multi-file vs 1024 CReLU (REJECTED)
- **Change**: 1536-wide CReLU net (multi-file 200SB) vs 1024 CReLU baseline (120SB).
- **Result**: **H0 at 469 games, -14.8 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Third 1536 rejection: single-file -23, multi-file CReLU -15, multi-file SCReLU -62. More data and longer training didn't help. 1536 width is not viable with our search — the NPS penalty (~200K vs ~790K at 1024) outweighs any eval quality gain. Low draw ratio (48%) persists across all 1536 tests, suggesting the wider net produces less stable evals.

### V5: Cap LMR Continuous History (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Replace discrete capture history LMR thresholds (±2000 → ±1 reduction) with continuous `reduction -= captHistVal / 5000`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1119 games, -1.6 Elo.** Early mirage of +9.6 at 818 games collapsed.
- **Notes**: The discrete thresholds at ±2000 are well-calibrated. Continuous adjustment over-smooths — bad captures that deserve more reduction get too little, good captures that deserve less get too much. The hard cutoffs act as effective noise filters.

### V5: History-Based LMP (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Adjust LMP limit by move's history score: <-3000 tightens by 1/3, >3000 loosens by 1/3.
- **Result**: **H0 at 681 games, -5.6 Elo.**
- **Notes**: LMP already uses move count as a proxy for move quality (moves are ordered by history). Adding explicit history adjustment is redundant — the move ordering already ensures low-history moves appear late and get pruned by the existing count-based limit.

### V5: Failing-Aware NMP (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Skip NMP at depths 3-6 when position is failing (eval deteriorating significantly).
- **Result**: **H0 at 428 games, -13.0 Elo.**
- **Notes**: NMP is valuable even in failing positions. The null-move hypothesis tests absolute eval vs beta, not the trend. Restricting NMP at shallow depths removes critical pruning exactly where it saves the most work. Consistent with v4 result: "NMP at depth 3-7 is well-calibrated."

### V5: LMP 4+d² (RETEST CANDIDATE — small positive)
- **Change**: LMP formula from `3 + depth*depth` to `4 + depth*depth` (one extra move allowed before pruning).
- **Result**: **H0 at 2453 games, +2.3 Elo (wide bounds elo0=-5/elo1=15).** Consistently showed +3-5 Elo / 75-85% LOS throughout but never enough LLR to pass wide bounds.
- **Notes**: Likely a genuine ~3-4 Elo gain. Retest with tight bounds (elo0=0, elo1=8, 5000+ games) when distributed testing is available. Do not re-reject — the wide SPRT was the wrong tool for this effect size.

### V5: Capture LMR C=1.40 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Reduce capture LMR table constant from 1.80 to 1.40 (less reduction on captures).
- **Result**: **H0 at 948 games, -2.6 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Less reduction means searching captures more deeply, costing NPS without improving accuracy. The current capture LMR constant (1.80) is well-calibrated — captures already get less reduction than quiets (C=1.50), so further reduction is wasteful.

### V5: SEE Quiet Threshold -25d² (LIKELY REJECT)
- **Change**: Tighter SEE quiet threshold from -20d² to -25d².
- **Result**: -1.2 Elo at 597 games, LLR -1.38. Still running but flat.
- **Notes**: Tightening the threshold prunes more aggressively. Early crash to -31 at 118 games recovered to ~0, suggesting the change is roughly neutral but not beneficial. Current -20d² is well-calibrated.

### V5: SEE Quiet Threshold -25d² (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighter SEE quiet threshold from -20d² to -25d².
- **Result**: **H0 at 841 games, -4.5 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Tighter threshold prunes more quiet moves, but the extra pruning removes moves that were worth searching. Current -20d² is well-calibrated. Tested in both directions now: -25d² loses, depth 9 extension is flat — the SEE quiet parameters are at their optimum.

### V5: Unstable LMR -2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Double the LMR reduction bonus for unstable positions (reduction -= 2 instead of -= 1).
- **Result**: **H0 at 152 games, -39.0 Elo.** Decisive.
- **Notes**: Reducing by 2 in volatile positions searches too many extra nodes. The current -1 adjustment is well-calibrated — it gives enough caution without burning NPS on every unstable node. This is consistent with the pattern: guard adjustments work best as single-ply nudges, not aggressive changes.

### V5: SEE Quiet Depth 9 (RETEST CANDIDATE — small positive)
- **Change**: Extend SEE quiet pruning from `depth <= 8` to `depth <= 9`.
- **Result**: Killed at 1290 games, +2.5 Elo, 66% LOS, LLR -1.32. Consistent +2-7 Elo throughout but fading.
- **Notes**: Another small positive that can't clear wide SPRT bounds. Retest with tight bounds (elo0=0, elo1=8) when distributed testing available.

### V5: 1024 Multi-file sb120 vs Baseline (REJECTED — WDL confound!)
- **Change**: 1024 CReLU trained on 3 files (multi-file) for 120SB with wdl=0.0, vs baseline trained single-file 120SB with wdl=0.5.
- **Result**: **H0 at 84 games, -93.2 Elo.** Catastrophic.
- **Notes**: **CRITICAL FINDING**: The wdl=0.0 vs wdl=0.5 training difference is the dominant factor, NOT data diversity or architecture. All multi-file configs (1536 CReLU, 1536 SCReLU, 1024 multi) used wdl=0.0 while the baseline used wdl=0.5. This means the 1536 rejection results (-15, -62 Elo) are CONFOUNDED — they may be mostly wdl penalty, not architecture penalty. All multi-file nets must be retrained with wdl=0.5 for valid comparison.

### V5: Threat-Aware SEE Quiet (RETEST CANDIDATE — small positive)
- **Change**: Loosen SEE quiet threshold by -100 when threatSq >= 0 (opponent has detected threats).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1675 games, +0.8 Elo (wide bounds elo0=-5/elo1=15).** Showed +5-12 Elo for first 1000 games, then regressed.
- **Notes**: Early signal was strong (+12.6 at 730 games, 94% LOS) but didn't hold. The idea is sound — be more cautious pruning when opponent has threats — but the effect may be ~3-4 Elo. Retest with tight bounds.

### V5: QS Delta 200 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten QS delta pruning margin from 240 to 200.
- **Result**: **H0 at 331 games, -16.8 Elo.**
- **Notes**: QS delta 240 was already tuned (merged as +31.2 Elo from the original 0→240 change). Tightening further prunes too many captures in QS that were tactically relevant. 240 is the optimal margin.

### V5: Countermove LMR Bonus (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Reduce LMR by 1 for countermove hits (similar to killer exemption).
- **Result**: **H0 at 555 games, -6.9 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Unlike killers (which are position-specific refutations), countermoves are a weaker signal — they refuted the opponent's move in a *different* position. The existing move ordering already places countermoves after killers, and LMR's continuous history adjustment already gives well-ordered moves less reduction. Adding a discrete bonus on top is redundant and slightly harmful.

### V5: QS SEE < -50 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Allow slightly losing captures (SEE > -50 instead of > 0) in quiescence search.
- **Result**: **H0 at 795 games, -3.9 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Searching SEE-negative captures in QS adds NPS cost without improving tactical accuracy. The SEE > 0 filter is well-calibrated — captures that lose material are rarely worth exploring in QS.

### V5: LMR Quiet C=1.20 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: More aggressive quiet LMR reduction (divisor from 1.30 to 1.20).
- **Result**: **H0 at 322 games, -17.3 Elo.**
- **Notes**: C=1.30 was already tuned down from 1.50 for v5. Going further to 1.20 is too aggressive — the extra reduction misses tactical quiet moves. C=1.30 is the optimum for v5's eval.

### V5: QS Stand-Pat Blend (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Blend QS stand-pat beta cutoff: return `(bestScore + beta) / 2` instead of `bestScore`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 472 games, -11.0 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Unlike TT-dampen and FH-blend (which work at search boundaries where scores are noisy), the QS stand-pat score is a direct static eval — already well-calibrated. Dampening it toward beta loses information. The low draw ratio (58% vs typical 64%) suggests it destabilizes the search by returning inaccurate QS scores.

### V5: RFP Margins 90/55 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: RFP margins from 100/70 to 90/55 (looser non-improving, tighter improving).
- **Result**: **H0 at 183 games, -34.3 Elo.** Decisive.
- **Notes**: Current RFP margins (100/70) are well-calibrated for v5. The 55 improving margin prunes too aggressively in improving positions.

### V5: Singular Extensions v2 — SF-like params (IN PROGRESS — still negative)
- **Change**: Re-enabled singular extensions with fixed wiring AND Stockfish-like parameters: depth>=8, margin 3*depth/2, verification (depth-1)/2.
- **Status**: -45.4 Elo at 103 games. Still running but likely to H0.
- **Notes**: Even with correct implementation and conservative parameters, singular extensions hurt. Low draw ratio (53%) suggests search instability. May interact badly with our other extensions/reductions (alpha-reduce, failing heuristic, FH-blend). Needs deeper investigation — possibly the verification search interferes with our correction history or TT-dampen patterns.

### V5: Singular Extensions v2 — SF-like params (REJECTED — needs investigation)
- **Change**: Singular extensions with fixed wiring + SF-like params: depth>=8, margin 3*depth/2, verification (depth-1)/2.
- **Result**: **H0 at 127 games, -58.0 Elo.** Catastrophic even with correct implementation.
- **Notes**: Three attempts all failed badly: (1) original broken code (discarded extension), (2) fixed wiring + original params depth>=10/margin=depth*3, (3) fixed wiring + SF params depth>=8/margin=3*depth/2. The low draw ratio (53%) suggests search destabilization. Singular extensions are a proven +20-30 Elo technique in other engines. Our implementation is fundamentally incompatible with something in our search — possibly alpha-reduce, failing heuristic, or FH-blend interacting with the verification search. **TODO**: Investigate by disabling alpha-reduce/failing/FH-blend one at a time with singular enabled to isolate the conflict.

### V5: ProbCut Depth 4 (RETEST CANDIDATE — small positive)
- **Change**: Enable ProbCut at depth >= 4 (was depth >= 5).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1255 games, -0.3 Elo.** Showed +4-8 Elo for most of its run before collapsing.
- **Notes**: Another consistent small positive that couldn't clear wide bounds. Retest with tight bounds.

### V5: RFP Depth 9 (LIKELY REJECT)
- **Change**: Extend RFP from depth <= 7 to depth <= 8.
- **Status**: -0.7 Elo at 984 games, LLR -2.44. Dead flat, nearly H0.

### V5: RFP Depth 9 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Extend RFP from depth <= 7 to depth <= 8.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1091 games, -1.6 Elo.** Dead flat.
- **Notes**: RFP depth 7 is well-calibrated. At depth 8, the margin (100*8=800cp non-improving) is already very wide, and positions that far ahead don't need the pruning savings.

### V5: ContHist Aging 12288 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Faster gravity decay on continuation history table (divisor 16384 → 12288).
- **Result**: **H0 at 212 games, -26.3 Elo.** Decisive.
- **Notes**: Continuation history captures positional patterns across move pairs — these are stable properties that don't change game-to-game. Faster decay loses this information. Main history (from/to) may benefit from faster decay (hist-age still running) because it tracks move-specific tactical patterns that are more volatile. Different history tables need different decay rates.

### V5: CapHist Aging 12288 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Faster gravity decay on capture history table (divisor 16384 → 12288).
- **Result**: **H0 at 215 games, -29.2 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Capture history patterns (which piece captures which type on which square) are stable across positions. Faster decay loses this information. Confirms: only main history (from/to) might benefit from faster decay — contHist and capHist need 16384 stickiness.

### V5: History Aging 12288 (RETEST CANDIDATE — small positive)
- **Change**: Faster gravity decay on main history table (divisor 16384 → 12288).
- **Status**: +1.8 Elo at 980 games, fading from peak of +27 at 149 games. Likely H0.
- **Notes**: Strong early signal that didn't hold. The main history table may benefit from slightly faster decay but the effect is too small for wide SPRT bounds. Retest with tight bounds, or try intermediate values (14336).

### V5: NMP Deep Reduction d>=14 (RETEST CANDIDATE — small positive)
- **Change**: Extra +1 NMP reduction when depth >= 14.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1657 games, +0.6 Elo.** Showed +4-9 Elo for first 1000 games.
- **Notes**: Consistent small positive (~2-4 Elo) that faded. Retest with tight bounds.

### V5: History Aging 12288 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Faster gravity decay on main history table (divisor 16384 → 12288).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1635 games, +0.4 Elo.** Early peak of +27 at 149 games was pure noise.
- **Notes**: Main history gravity at 16384 is well-calibrated. Tested all three history tables (main, conthist, caphist) — all rejected. The gravity divisor is not a productive tuning dimension.

### V5: NMP Divisor 150 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: More aggressive NMP eval-based reduction (divisor 200 → 150).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1418 games, 0.0 Elo.** Perfectly flat.
- **Notes**: NMP divisor 200 confirmed well-calibrated for v5. Tested both directions now: 150 (flat) and noted in earlier experiments that the divisor is not a productive dimension.

### V5: Passed Pawn LMR (LIKELY REJECT)
- **Change**: Reduce LMR by 1 for pawn moves to 6th/7th rank.
- **Status**: -2.3 Elo at 479 games, flat/negative.
- **Notes**: Advanced pawn moves are already handled well by the history table — good pawn pushes get high history scores and receive less reduction through the continuous history adjustment. An explicit pawn rank check is redundant.

### V5: Passed Pawn LMR (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Reduce LMR by 1 for pawn moves to 6th/7th rank.
- **Result**: **H0 at 831 games, -3.3 Elo.**
- **Notes**: History-based continuous LMR adjustment already handles good pawn pushes — they get high history scores and less reduction organically. Explicit piece-type checks are redundant.

### V5: QS Evasion LMP (RETEST CANDIDATE — small positive)
- **Change**: Prune late quiet evasion moves (moveCount > 4) in quiescence when in check.
- **Status**: +2.9 Elo at 1474 games, fading. Showed +6-8 Elo for first 1000 games.
- **Notes**: Another small positive. Retest with tight bounds.

### V5: QS Evasion LMP (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Prune late quiet evasion moves (moveCount > 4) in quiescence when in check.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1690 games, +0.6 Elo.** Showed +6-8 Elo for first 1000 games before collapsing.
- **Notes**: Another strong early signal that didn't hold. QS evasion handling is already efficient.

### V5: Persist ContHist /2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Halve continuation history between searches instead of clearing.
- **Result**: **H0 at 201 games, -29.5 Elo.**
- **Notes**: ContHist captures move-pair patterns that are position-specific. Persisting them between games (different positions) pollutes the table with irrelevant patterns. Unlike main history which is more generic (from/to squares), contHist is too contextual to persist.

### V5: Aspiration Widen 2x (RETEST CANDIDATE — small positive)
- **Change**: Aspiration window widening from 1.5x to 2x on fail-high/fail-low.
- **Status**: +0.4 Elo at 976 games, fading. Peaked at +13.9 at 605 games.
- **Notes**: Showed consistent early signal before collapsing. Retest with tight bounds.

### V5: Persist History /2 (LIKELY REJECT)
- **Change**: Halve main history between searches instead of clearing.
- **Status**: -3.5 Elo at 617 games, heading H0.
- **Notes**: Was a merged win on v4 but doesn't help on v5. The v5 NNUE eval may produce different move ordering patterns that don't transfer well between games, or the TT (which persists across games) already provides sufficient inter-game knowledge.

### V5: Persist History /2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Halve main history between searches instead of clearing to zero.
- **Result**: **H0 at 691 games, -5.5 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Was a merged win on v4 but harmful on v5. The v5 NNUE eval produces different move ordering dynamics. Clearing history gives the search a fresh start each game, which is better with v5's stronger eval guiding move ordering from scratch.

### V5: Aspiration Widen 2x (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Aspiration window widening from 1.5x to 2x on fail-high/fail-low.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1270 games, -0.5 Elo.** Peaked at +13.9/94% LOS at 605 games before collapsing.
- **Notes**: The 1.5x widening is well-calibrated. 2x widens too fast, reaching full window sooner and losing the aspiration window benefit. Another dramatic early signal that was pure noise.

### V5: Non-Linear Output Buckets (REJECTED — incompatible)
- **Change**: Alexandria's output bucket formula `(63-pc)(32-pc)/225` replacing our linear `(pc-2)/4`.
- **Result**: 0 wins, 37 losses in 37 games. Catastrophic.
- **Notes**: The net was TRAINED with linear bucket mapping. Changing the bucket selection at inference without retraining maps positions to wrong output weight sets. This is a training-time change, not an inference-time change. Would need to retrain the net with the new formula to test properly.

### V5: Singular Extensions — Alexandria Params (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Alexandria-style singular: depth>=6, margin 5*depth/8, fail-high cutoff returning beta.
- **Result**: **H0 at 96 games, -84.9 Elo.** Even worse than SF-like params (-58 Elo).
- **Notes**: Diagnostic tests (200 games each, singular + one feature disabled):
  - SE + no alpha-reduce: -51 Elo (slightly less bad)
  - SE + no failing: -72 Elo
  - SE + no FH-blend: -98 Elo (worse — FH-blend was helping)
  - SE + no TT-dampen: -100 Elo (worse — TT-dampen was helping)
  None of our unique features conflict with singular. The issue is structural — possibly our TT replacement policy, move ordering, or search tree shape is fundamentally incompatible. Needs deeper investigation (trace singular verification search decisions, compare with a known-working engine).

### V5: Hindsight Reduction (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Reduce depth by 1 when eval hasn't changed much over 2 plies (diff < 155cp).
- **Result**: **H0 at 91 games, -81.6 Elo.** Catastrophic.
- **Notes**: The threshold 155cp may be too loose for our eval scale, or the eval comparison across 2 plies isn't meaningful with our NNUE eval. Alexandria may use this with a differently scaled eval.

### V5: RFP Score Blending (REJECTED)
- **Change**: RFP returns `(eval-margin + beta) / 2` instead of `eval - margin`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 355 games, -16.7 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Unlike TT-dampen and FH-blend (which work at noisy boundaries), RFP pruning is a clean cutoff — the eval IS far above beta. Blending the return toward beta loses accurate information. Dampening doesn't work at every boundary.

### LMR Quiet C=1.30 (MERGED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.30 (more aggressive reduction).
- **Result**: **H1 at 1016 games, +13.3 Elo ±14.7, LOS 96.3%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: aee6f1d (TT near-miss 80 merged)
- **Notes**: Perfectly bracketed: 1.25 (H0, -3.6), **1.30 (H1, +13.3)**, 1.35 (H0, +1.2), 1.40 (H0, -2.9), 1.50 (previous), 1.60 (H0, -29.1). The LMR progression continues: C=2.0→1.75(+16.2)→1.50(+44.4)→1.30(+13.3). More aggressive quiet LMR works because NNUE eval is accurate enough to trust shallower searches for non-critical moves.

### LMR Quiet C=1.35 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.35.
- **Result**: **H0 at 2063 games, +1.2 Elo ±9.9, LOS 59.2%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Notes**: Dead flat. The optimum is sharply at 1.30, not a gradual slope.

### LMR Quiet C=1.25 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten quiet LMR constant from 1.50 to 1.25.
- **Result**: **H0 at 959 games, -3.6 Elo ±14.8, LOS 31.6%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Notes**: Too aggressive. Confirms 1.30 as the sharp optimum.

### V5: NMP R-1 After Captures (MERGED)
- **Change**: Reduce NMP R by 1 when the previous move was a capture (position is more forcing).
- **Result**: **H1 at 704 games, +14.8 Elo ±15.8, LOS 96.7%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 8d92fc4 (LMR quiet C=1.30 merged)
- **Notes**: Captures make positions more forcing — null move assumption is riskier when opponent just captured. Source: Tucano. 3 lines of code.

### V5: Futility History Gate (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Don't futility-prune moves with combined history > 12000.
- **Result**: **H0 at 771 games, -5.0 Elo ±15.8, LOS 26.9%.**
- **Notes**: Showed +15 Elo at 400 games (90% LOS) then collapsed. Classic early noise. The futility margin is well-calibrated — history-gating adds complexity without benefit. Source: Igel.

### V5: Mate Distance Pruning (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighten alpha/beta bounds when a shorter mate is already known (standard MDP).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1559 games, +0.7 Elo ±10.4, LOS 55.0%.**
- **Notes**: Dead flat. Universal technique but our search rarely encounters positions where MDP would trigger (deep mates found at the root that need pruning at leaf nodes). The overhead of the alpha/beta adjustment at every node isn't justified.

### V5: Complexity-Adjusted LMR (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Reduce LMR less when correction history magnitude is large (uncertain eval needs deeper search). `reduction -= complexity / 120`.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1338 games, 0.0 Elo ±11.3, LOS 50.0%.**
- **Notes**: Perfectly flat. The correction history magnitude doesn't correlate with positional complexity strongly enough to improve LMR. Source: Obsidian uses this but with different scaling.

### Cap LMR C=1.90 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Less aggressive capture LMR (divisor from 1.80 to 1.90).
- **Result**: **H0 at 749 games, -6.0 Elo ±16.7, LOS 24.0%.**
- **Notes**: Capture LMR C=1.80 is well-calibrated. Less reduction (1.90) searches captures too deeply.

### NMP Stronger (REJECTED)
- **Change**: More aggressive NMP (details from experiment queue).
- **Result**: **H0 at 208 games, -33.5 Elo ±31.4, LOS 1.9%.** Decisive.

### Correction History Depth 2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Lower correction history depth gate from >=3 to >=2.
- **Result**: **H0 at 277 games, -23.9 Elo ±27.0, LOS 4.2%.**
- **Notes**: Depth-2 scores are too shallow/noisy for correction history updates. Depth>=3 is well-calibrated.

### V5: Score-Drop Time Extension (MERGED)
- **Change**: More aggressive time scaling on score drops: 2.0x at >50cp (was 1.4x), 1.5x at >25cp (was 1.2x), new 1.2x tier at >10cp.
- **Result**: **H1 at 793 games, +13.6 Elo ±14.8, LOS 96.3%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: c6447e8 (dynamic NNUE width)
- **Notes**: Gives the engine more time to recover in volatile positions where the score drops between iterations. Source: Tucano-style aggressive scaling.

### V5: SE Fixed — Pruning Guards (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Gate NMP, RFP, razoring, ProbCut on `!excludedMove` during SE verification search. Diagnosis found NMP was short-circuiting the verification.
- **Result**: **H0 at 71 games, -105.9 Elo.** Still catastrophic despite fixing the identified bug.
- **Notes**: The pruning guards helped (was -140, now -106) but SE is still fundamentally broken. There are likely additional interactions with TT dampening, FH-blend, alpha-reduce, or NMP dampening that corrupt the verification search.

### V5: NMP Base R=4 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Increase NMP base reduction from R=3 to R=4 (Alexandria/Berserk/Obsidian use R=4).
- **Result**: **H0 at 307 games, -17.0 Elo.** Decisive.
- **Notes**: Our R=3 is well-calibrated. Other engines have different search frameworks (singular extensions, cutNode tracking) that interact with NMP differently.

### V5: IIR Extra on PV (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Double IIR reduction on PV nodes without TT move (`depth -= 1 + pvNode`).
- **Result**: **H0 at 237 games, -26.4 Elo.**
- **Notes**: PV nodes without TT moves are important — reducing them too much loses accuracy. Source: Altair.

### V5: Cutnode LMR +2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Increase cut-node quiet LMR reduction from +1 to +2.
- **Result**: **H0 at 881 games, -3.2 Elo.** Dead flat.
- **Notes**: Our +1 cut-node reduction is well-calibrated. +2 is too aggressive — it misses tactical quiet moves at cut nodes.

### V5: SE Alexandria (REJECTED — 5th attempt)
- **Change**: Full Alexandria-style SE: depth>=6, margin d*5/8, ply limiter, multi-cut, double/triple ext, negative ext -2.
- **Result**: **H0 at 55 games, -139.7 Elo.** Catastrophic (5th consecutive SE failure).
- **Notes**: Root cause identified: NMP fires inside verification search (see se-diagnosis.md). Fixed in SE-Fixed variant but still -106 Elo. Additional interactions remain.

### V5: Quadratic 50-Move Scaling (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Scale eval by `(200-hmc)²/40000` as halfmove clock advances.
- **Result**: **H0 at 340 games, -13.3 Elo.** 
- **Notes**: Quadratic scaling (Reckless/Minic) loses more Elo than our previous linear test (H0, -3.0). The 50-move rule rarely matters in self-play at 10+0.1s — games don't last that long. Any scaling just adds noise.

### V5: ProbCut QS Pre-Filter (KILLED — flat)
- **Change**: Run QS before full ProbCut search; only do expensive search if QS confirms.
- **Result**: Killed at 287 games, +3.5 Elo. Flat.
- **Notes**: QS pre-filter adds overhead without improving ProbCut accuracy at our depths. 4 engines have this (Alexandria, Tucano, Berserk, Weiss) but it may only help with deeper searches.

### V5: NMP Threat Guard (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Disable NMP at depth<=7 when opponent pawns attack our non-pawn pieces.
- **Result**: **H0 at 236 games, -23.6 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Too conservative — NMP is still valuable even under minor pawn threats. The eval already accounts for threats. Source: Berserk/RubiChess/Koivisto pattern, but our engine handles it differently.

### V5: NMP Threat Guard (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Disable NMP at depth<=7 when opponent pawns attack our non-pawn pieces.
- **Result**: **H0 at 236 games, -23.6 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Too conservative — NMP is still valuable even under minor pawn threats. The eval already accounts for threats.

### V5: Improving-Aware Capture LMR (IN PROGRESS)
- **Status**: +4.2 Elo at 1005 games, 73.8% LOS. Flat, likely H0.

### V5: ProbCut Margin 150 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighter ProbCut margin from beta+170 to beta+150.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1386 games, +0.3 Elo.** Dead flat.
- **Notes**: ProbCut margin 170 is well-calibrated. 150 prunes too aggressively, removing positions worth searching.

### V5: Improving-Aware Capture LMR (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Reduce capture LMR by 1 when position is improving.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1434 games, +0.2 Elo.** Dead flat.
- **Notes**: Capture LMR already has history-based adjustment. Adding an improving flag is redundant — the capture history captures this information implicitly.

### V5: LMR History Divisor 6000 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Less aggressive history-based LMR adjustment (divisor 5000→6000).
- **Result**: **H0 at 241 games, -23.1 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Our divisor 5000 is well-calibrated. Less aggressive history response means good moves get less reduction relief, losing tactical accuracy. Alexandria uses 8300 but with a very different search framework.

### V5: Aspiration Fail-Low Beta Contraction (MERGED)
- **Change**: More aggressive beta contraction on aspiration fail-low: `(3*alpha + 5*beta) / 8` instead of `(alpha + beta) / 2`.
- **Result**: **H1 at 1193 games, +10.5 Elo ±11.9, LOS 95.8%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: cff9599 (score-drop TM merged)
- **Notes**: Tighter beta contraction helps converge faster on the true score when failing low. Source: Altair uses `(3*alpha + 5*beta) / 8`, Midnight contracts on fail-low similarly.

### V5: RFP Improving Margin 60 (LIKELY REJECT)
- **Status**: Collapsed from +13.9 at 317 games to +0.5 at 658 games. Classic early noise.
- **Notes**: RFP improving margin 70 is well-calibrated for v5.

### V5: RFP Improving Margin 60 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Tighter RFP improving margin from depth*70 to depth*60.
- **Result**: **H0 at 853 games, -2.9 Elo.** Dead flat.
- **Notes**: Improving margin 70 is well-calibrated. 60 prunes too aggressively in improving positions. Bracket: 60 (H0), 70 (current), 80 (testing).

### V5: Aspiration Fail-High Alpha Contraction (MERGED)
- **Change**: Less aggressive alpha contraction on fail-high: `(5*alpha + 3*beta) / 8` instead of `alpha = beta`.
- **Result**: **H1 at 200 games, +38.4 Elo ±29.2, LOS 99.5%.** SPRT bounds: elo0=-5, elo1=15.
- **Baseline**: 4994e27 (asp fail-low contraction merged)
- **Notes**: The old `alpha = beta` was too aggressive — it jumped alpha all the way to beta, then widened beta. The gentler contraction keeps some of the window below the fail-high score, reducing re-search overhead. Combined with the fail-low contraction, both sides of the aspiration window now use smooth contraction.

### V5: RFP Improving Margin 80 (IN PROGRESS)
- **Status**: -1.3 Elo at 546 games, heading H0. Brackets: 60 (H0), 70 (current), 80 (flat). Margin 70 confirmed optimal.

### V5: StatBonus on Strong Fail-High (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Use `historyBonus(depth+1)` when score > beta+95 at beta cutoff.
- **Result**: Collapsed from +27.4 at 158 games to -3.3 at 428 games. Heading H0.
- **Notes**: Early noise. The bonus at depth+1 is too small a change to measure.

### V5: ASP Fail-High (3a+5b)/8 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Less aggressive fail-high alpha contraction: (3a+5b)/8 instead of (5a+3b)/8.
- **Result**: -11.6 Elo at 429 games, heading H0. Confirms (5a+3b)/8 is optimal.

### V5: NMP PostCap R-2 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: R-2 NMP reduction after captures (bracket of R-1).
- **Result**: **H0 at 201 games, -27.7 Elo.** R-2 is too cautious after captures. R-1 confirmed optimal.

### V5: RFP Improving Margin 80 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Looser RFP improving margin from depth*70 to depth*80.
- **Result**: **H0 at 1194 games, -0.6 Elo.** Dead flat. Bracket complete: 60 (H0), 70 (current), 80 (H0). Margin 70 confirmed optimal.

### V5: ASP Delta Growth 2.0x (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Faster aspiration delta growth: `delta += delta` (2.0x) instead of `delta += delta/2` (1.5x).
- **Result**: **H0 at 164 games, -34.0 Elo.** Decisive.
- **Notes**: Widening too fast reaches full window too quickly, losing the aspiration benefit. Bracket: 1.33x (testing), 1.5x (current), 2.0x (H0).

## Singular Extensions Deep Dive (2026-03-20)

### SE v6: NMP-guarded + full features (REJECTED)
- **Change**: SE with NMP disabled inside verification, RFP/ProbCut active, multi-cut (singularBeta>=beta), negative ext (-1 when ttScore>=beta), margin=depth*1, depth>=8, ply limiter.
- **Result**: **H0 at 211 games, -33.0 Elo ±31.3.**
- **Baseline**: ec7dab6 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: The positive extension (+1 for singular moves) is actively harmful. Extensions make the TT move search deeper but don't improve play — likely because v5 NNUE already evaluates well at current depth.

### SE v7: Multi-cut + negative ext only, NO positive extension (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Same as v6 but positive extension disabled (singularExtension stays 0 when singular). Only multi-cut (return singularBeta when singularBeta >= beta) and negative ext (-1 when ttScore >= beta but not singular).
- **Result**: **H0 at 1148 games, -1.5 Elo ±12.9.** Dead flat.
- **Baseline**: ec7dab6 with v5 sb120 net
- **Notes**: Multi-cut + negative ext perfectly offset the verification search cost, confirming they work correctly. The positive extension is the problem — v6 (-33 Elo) minus v7 (-1.5 Elo) implies the extension alone costs ~30 Elo.

### SE Root Cause Analysis
**Finding**: SE's positive extension hurts our engine (~-30 Elo) despite being +20-30 in reference engines. The verification search infrastructure (multi-cut, negative ext) works correctly and breaks even. Key hypotheses for why extensions hurt:
1. **v5 NNUE eval accuracy**: Strong positional eval may already capture what extensions aim to find
2. **Extension interactions**: Alpha-reduce, fail-high blending, or other features may conflict with SE extensions
3. **Node budget**: Extensions at depth >= 8 create large subtrees that reduce remaining budget for other critical moves
4. **Extension quality**: Our SE extends at depth >= 8 only, which may target the wrong nodes (too deep, less tactical)

**Next steps**: Test fractional extensions (+0.5 ply), restrict extensions to quiet TT moves only, or try at depth >= 6 with very tight margin.

### Model: SB200 vs SB120 wdl=0.0 6-file (NEUTRAL)
- **Change**: 200 superbatches vs 120, same wdl=0.0, same 6 T80 files, same architecture.
- **Result**: +1.0 Elo at 376 games, dead flat. Killed — heading H0.
- **Notes**: Validation loss showed sb200 slightly overfitting, confirmed in play. 120 SBs is optimal for wdl=0.0 1024 CReLU. The wdl=0.5 sb200 gains (+98 to +243 internal) were an artifact of undertrained wdl=0.5 nets needing more epochs.

### Model: 1024 wdl=0.0 6-file sb120 vs Production (NEUTRAL)
- **Change**: Same architecture, wdl=0.0, but 6 T80 files instead of 1.
- **Result**: -3.1 Elo at 798 games, heading H0. Pipeline reproduction confirmed.
- **Notes**: Extra data diversity doesn't help at 1024-wide with 120 SBs. But critically: the new Bullet version produces equivalent-strength nets. Training pipeline is proven reproducible.

### V5: ASP Delta Growth 1.33x (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Slower aspiration delta growth: `delta += delta/3` (1.33x) instead of 1.5x.
- **Result**: **H0 at 391 games, -9.8 Elo.** Bracket: 1.33x (H0), 1.5x (current), 2.0x (H0). Growth rate 1.5x confirmed optimal.

### V5: Bugfix Impact (NEUTRAL)
- **Change**: Atlas code review fixes: v5 SMP DeepCopy, int64 overflow, ARM stubs, etc.
- **Result**: +4.3 Elo at 550 games, flat. No regression confirmed. The int32 overflow fix only affects scalar path (SIMD still int32).

### V5: ASP Starting Delta 18 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Wider aspiration starting delta from 15 to 18.
- **Result**: Collapsed from +31 at 101 games to +3.3 at 755 games. Heading H0.
- **Notes**: Delta 15 is optimal even with the new contraction parameters. Bracket: 12 (H0), 15 (current), 18 (H0).

### V5: ASP Min Depth 5 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Only use aspiration windows at depth >= 5 (was >= 4).
- **Result**: **H0 at 538 games, -7.8 Elo.**

### V5: TM Aggressive Stability (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Stronger early stop on stable best move: 0.25x at 8+ (was 0.35x), 0.4x at 5+ (was 0.5x).
- **Result**: **H0 at 403 games, -14.7 Elo.**

### V5: IIR Depth 7 (REJECTED)
- **Change**: Raise IIR gate from depth >= 6 to depth >= 7.
- **Result**: **H0 at 343 games, -15.2 Elo.**
- **Notes**: Finny NPS boost doesn't change optimal IIR threshold.
